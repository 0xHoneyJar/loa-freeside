## Sprint Documentation Structure

Each sprint directory contains:
- `reviewer.md` - Engineer's implementation report
- `engineer-feedback.md` - Technical lead's review feedback
- `auditor-report.md` - Security audit findings (if applicable)
- `COMPLETED` - Marker file when sprint is fully complete

## Workflow

1. `/implement sprint-N` - Creates `reviewer.md` with implementation details
2. `/review-sprint sprint-N` - Creates `engineer-feedback.md` with review
3. `/audit-sprint sprint-N` - Creates `auditor-report.md` with security findings
4. On final approval, `COMPLETED` marker is created
