    {
      "original_issue": "AC-1.1 required `ZRANGEBYSCORE` but implementation used `ZREMRANGEBYSCORE` + `ZCARD` (AC/implementation mismatch)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "AC-1.1 is aligned to the intended sliding-window algorithm (`ZREMRANGEBYSCORE` + `ZADD` + `ZCARD`) and the plan text matches it."

      "original_issue": "Zero-downtime migration underspecified for mixed-fleet concurrency; risk of lost/duplicated failures during rollout",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.1 now specifies a two-phase rollout where new code dual-writes (ZSET + CSV) and also migrates CSV→ZSET on each call, plus clears both on success. This ensures old and new containers observe the same fleet-wide failure stream during the rollout window, which resolves the prior correctness risk. AC-1.20 and AC-1.23 explicitly cover mixed-fleet safety and require a simulation test."

      "original_issue": "Compatibility matrix loading via `readFileSync` at module init is brittle in packaged/bundled Node environments",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The plan uses TS JSON module import with `resolveJsonModule`, avoiding runtime file I/O and path resolution issues."

      "original_issue": "AC-1.19 was unrealistic as written (implied no rebuild/redeploy needed for data changes)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "AC-1.19 is now scoped to 'edit only compatibility.json (no TS source changes)', which is testable and reasonable under normal publish/redeploy."

      "original_issue": "Audit runtime validation lacked explicit tests to prove warn+skip behavior and log shape",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "AC-1.21 and AC-1.22 require unit tests for invalid/valid events asserting warn+skip vs info emission, matching the non-blocking audit requirement."
