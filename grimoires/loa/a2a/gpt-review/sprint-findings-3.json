      "original_issue": "Task 3.2 mixed CI-implementable code/DB work with untestable ops/infra deliverables (pgaudit/CloudWatch/cron/SLOs), making DoD unachievable",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still cleanly separated: 3.2 is explicitly code+DB migration with CI-provable AC; 3.3 is ops/infra and now explicitly a production release gate (which is consistent with the original intent and does not block code merge)."

      "original_issue": "Partitioning plan was ambiguous/incorrectly described (\"partition trigger inheritance\"), risking runtime insert failures when partitions are missing",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed and strengthened: native RANGE partitioning + DEFAULT partition safety net + idempotent partition creation function + scheduled job + CI headroom gate. This removes the insert-failure outage mode."

      "original_issue": "Integration tests did not cover several DB-enforced invariants required by Task 3.2 (RLS/privileges, triggers, uniqueness, skew, idempotency), risking unverified life-critical properties",

      "notes": "Still fixed: Sprint 4 Task 4.2 DB harness + enumerated 13 scenarios that cover privilege/RLS/trigger enforcement, cross-partition uniqueness, skew constraint, idempotency, and quarantine fail-closed behavior."
