  "summary": "The previously blocking Sprint 4 vs zero-tolerance naming gate deadlock is now explicitly reconciled in the plan and validator design, and no new truly blocking issues were introduced.",

    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 4 ECONOMICS.md pre-flight cites old/forbidden `themes/sietch/src/packages/core/protocol/arrakis-conservation.ts` path, conflicting with naming policy",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The plan now makes the exemption explicit and testable: RTFM validator check #2 must strip `<!-- cite: ... -->` blocks before running the `arrakis` grep, and Sprint 4.1 acceptance criteria explicitly allow `arrakis-*` only inside cite blocks while still requiring zero 'Arrakis' in prose. Sprint 5.1 expands scope to include ECONOMICS/EVENT-PROTOCOL, but because the validator exemption is defined centrally, the gate remains achievable."

      "original_issue": "Sprint 2.1 ts-morph AST vs Sprint 4.4 note claiming grep-based extractor (plan contradiction)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 2.1 explicitly allows AST or grep with a requirement to document the chosen approach, and Sprint 4.4’s coverage note is aligned to the actual grep-based method."

    {
      "original_issue": "Canonical 14 conservation properties vs freeside enforcing subset (Sprint 4/6/9 inconsistency)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 4.1 establishes loa-hounfour as normative canonical (14) and freeside as implemented coverage; Sprint 6.4 and Sprint 9.1 reinforce this with an explicit coverage ratio note and a required 14-row table."

    {
      "original_issue": "RTFM managed-doc scope ownership split/duplicated (GLOSSARY added twice; Sprint 10 dependency mismatch)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 8.3 is the introduction point for adding GLOSSARY.md to MANAGED_DOCS; Sprint 10.1 is verification-only with an explicit 'no redundant additions' criterion."

    {
      "original_issue": "verify-routes.sh acceptance criteria unsafe/flaky (HEAD/GET on every route; non-idempotent routes; 405 handling)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 2.4 constrains auth validation to indexed GET routes, uses safe probes for non-GET routes, treats 405 as non-fatal, and forbids bodies on non-idempotent routes."

    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 9 BUTTERFREEZONE discovery fields change lacks explicit golden vector/validator policy update",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 9.2 requires validator optional-field handling with advisory exit code 2, updates RTFM check #7 to accept 0 or 2, and regenerates/commits golden vectors."

      "original_issue": "No explicit bridge/deep review findings closure artifact mapping finding IDs to doc sections/validation evidence",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 10.4 defines a closure table artifact with required columns and CLOSED/DEFERRED rules, covering all 13 findings."
