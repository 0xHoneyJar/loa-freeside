      "original_issue": "Migration numbering/order inconsistent (046 before 043; violated monotonic ordering requirement)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: migrations are explicitly ordered 042 → 043 → 044 → 045 → 046, and the dependency section reiterates strict monotonic ordering."

      "original_issue": "CampaignAdapter/pool isolation for `referral:signup` non-withdrawable not explicitly implemented/tested",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: Sprint 3.4 registers pool IDs, marks `referral:signup` and `score:rewards` non-withdrawable, and includes an automated test asserting exclusion from withdrawable balance queries."

      "original_issue": "Phase 1A 'non-withdrawable' contradicted by Sprint 6/7 withdrawable semantics",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: Sprint 6 explicitly labels Phase 1A as `settled_available_micro` (non-withdrawable) and defers `withdrawable` to Phase 1B (Sprint 9), with dashboard semantics aligned."

      "original_issue": "Manual review queue referenced but not defined (no persistence/surfacing/approve-deny flow)",

      "original_issue": "Cleanup validation existed without earlier implementation tasks (nonce cleanup + referral_events retention)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: referral_events retention cleanup is implemented in Sprint 7.6; nonce cleanup is implemented in Sprint 11.4; Sprint 13.3 validates both."

      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: Sprint 8.1 specifies deterministic seeding with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and an AC verifying idempotency by running the migration twice."
