    {
      "original_issue": "Migration 0012 Phase 2 backfill used DO $$ ... COMMIT; inside loop (invalid in PostgreSQL)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The SDD now correctly states that DO blocks cannot COMMIT, and replaces the guidance with (a) an application/psql batch loop using UPDATE ... LIMIT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED with per-iteration commits, and (b) an optional CREATE PROCEDURE approach where COMMIT is valid. This resolves the operational correctness and online/backfill safety requirement."

      "notes": "The SDD now explicitly REVOKEs ALL from app_role and GRANTs INSERT only, with SELECT reserved for a separate audit_reader_role. This removes the cross-tenant read exposure and matches the stated platform-level audit intent."
