  "summary": "The two previously-blocking issues (unpinned clone/checkout and rollback env var mismatch) are fixed correctly, and the revised SDD remains internally consistent and implementable without introducing new truly-blocking problems.",

    {
      "original_issue": "Rebuild script clone/checkout was not actually pinned to the expected SHA (depth-1 clone then checkout could fail or drift)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "SDD §3.2 now uses a deterministic fetch-by-SHA flow (`git init` → `git fetch --depth 1 origin $EXPECTED_SHA` → `git checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD`) and then verifies `HEAD` equals `EXPECTED_SHA`. This reliably pins the build to the intended commit and satisfies the security intent of FR-2/AC-2.4."

    {
      "original_issue": "Rollback env var name contradicted implementation (runbook said PARSE_MICRO_USD_LEGACY but code used PARSE_MICRO_USD_MODE)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "SDD §7 rollback now correctly references `PARSE_MICRO_USD_MODE=legacy`, matching §3.6 implementation. This makes the kill-switch operational during incidents."
