  "summary": "The remaining blocker (ADR-001 guard brittleness) is now fixed with a valid runtime-schema identity check plus a curated import-specifier/identifier denylist, and no new truly blocking issues were introduced.",

    {
      "original_issue": "Barrel re-exports governance subpath symbols without verifying they exist at runtime (TASK_TYPES, validateTaskCohortUniqueness)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still correctly addressed via the explicit dynamic-import verification gate and the documented fallback actions for missing/type-only symbols."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Assumed computeScoringPathHash and SCORING_PATH_GENESIS_HASH are root exports; contract.json may point at wrong entrypoint",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still correctly addressed: SDD requires verifying the actual entrypoint and moving both barrel import and contract.json entry if the exports live under a subpath."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "evaluation_geometry exposure relied on an assumption that Constraint is already exported from the freeside barrel",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still correctly addressed: exposure is conditional on verifying existing barrel exports, with an explicit requirement to add Constraint/ConstraintSchema (and contract entry if runtime) if missing."

      "original_issue": "Rebuild script violates 'schema-only' intent and can introduce non-determinism/supply-chain risk",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still correctly addressed: the trust boundary is stated clearly and the verification requirements (exact ref, DIST_HASH recording/compare, tag compatibility, toolchain pin/limitation) are sufficient for this cycle."

    {
      "original_issue": "ADR-001 guard was brittle (grep-based) and could false-fail/false-pass; needed AST-based or stronger enforcement",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Layer 1 is now a compile-valid runtime check (schema object reference equality) rather than an invalid type-alias comparison, and Layer 2 now also denies governance subpath import specifiers (catching aliased imports). This is CI-enforceable and aligned with AC-1.6."
