  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "Iteration 3 integrates the Flatline findings without regressing the previously-approved fixes; the chain linearization/uniqueness, timestamp split, fail-closed safeguards, single-entry mutation coupling, reputation resolution, Phase C tightening, and pgaudit/partition-trigger defense-in-depth are all specified in an operationally sound way.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "append() concurrency could fork the hash chain (no DB-enforced linearization)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: SERIALIZABLE + per-domain_tag pg_advisory_xact_lock + audit_trail_head sequencing remains a clear linearization mechanism."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Prune plan contradicted append-only enforcement and implied trigger disablement",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: pruning is partition detach/drop with explicit 'triggers are NEVER disabled' plus checkpoint anchoring and continuity verification."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Append-only enforcement via RLS/privileges was claimed but not defined",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed and strengthened: explicit RLS policies, explicit role separation (app not owner), and least-privilege statements remain consistent with the design."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Quarantine did not define in-flight request behavior (fail closed vs buffer vs partial apply)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: governance-critical mutations rejected with 503 + Retry-After; non-critical telemetry explicitly routed outside the hash chain during quarantine; runbook added."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "actor_id trust boundary underspecified; actor_id nullable allowed unauthenticated entries",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: actor_id is NOT NULL + non-empty CHECK; resolveActorId() throws if no authenticated identity; service identity is mTLS-derived; JWT verification requirements are stated."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "DynamicContract loader failure modes and override controls were underspecified",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed and improved: startup failure matrix is explicit; override blocked in production and size-limited; monotonic expansion violations are fatal; CI/CD config gate + checksum + canary reduce outage risk while preserving fail-closed semantics."

    {
      "original_issue": "append() hashing inputs used non-deterministic timestamps, breaking idempotency on retry",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: event_time is caller-provided and included in hash; created_at is server-generated and excluded from hash; retry determinism is preserved."

    {
      "original_issue": "Version negotiation authority was ambiguous between local logic and hounfour",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Still fixed: validateCompatibility() remains the sole authority (delegated to hounfour), with explicit mixed-version tests and contract.json CI-only."
