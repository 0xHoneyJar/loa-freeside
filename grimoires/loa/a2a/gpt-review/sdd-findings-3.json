  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "The two remaining blockers from the prior review are fixed (settlement hold key normalization is now consistent, and Security/Risks sections no longer contradict the implemented idempotency/versioning mechanisms), and no new truly blocking issues were introduced.",

    {
      "original_issue": "SettlementService resolves `settlement.hold_hours` but schema/registry uses `settlement.hold_seconds`",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "§3.4 registry, §4.4 SettlementService sample, §5.1 API propose example, §7.2 seed data, and §4.7 fallback table all consistently use `settlement.hold_seconds` with no hours→seconds conversion. This removes the runtime lookup mismatch risk."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Security/Risks sections still referenced `last_finalize_id` and `MAX(config_version)+1` despite revised designs",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "§6.2 now correctly describes idempotency via `agent_budget_finalizations` PK(account_id,reservation_id) + `INSERT OR IGNORE`. §11 now correctly describes config version allocation via `system_config_version_seq` under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` plus UNIQUE(param_key, entity_type, config_version), and no longer mentions MAX+1 or last_finalize_id."
