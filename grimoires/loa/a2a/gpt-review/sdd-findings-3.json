  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously raised blockers are now addressed, and the remaining plan is coherent, correctly ordered, and should unblock all five CI gates without relying on brittle workarounds.",

    {
      "original_issue": "Lockfile regeneration / monorepo install topology mismatch could leave CI installing old hounfour SHA",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "SDD clearly states CI is per-package `npm ci` with per-package lockfiles, and the hounfour re-pin + lockfile regeneration is explicitly performed in each consuming package directory. Verification steps (resolved package + dist file existence) remain appropriate."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Breaking security upgrade mapping was incorrect/unrelated; needed targeted audit-path remediation",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Security section is now driven by concrete `npm audit --json` chains and removes the previously incorrect upgrade claims. Phase 1 uses non-breaking `npm audit fix`, and Phase 2 isolates the only breaking item (`node-vault`) with a clear contingency."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Disabling engine checks in CI is brittle and can still fail due to real Node incompatibility; should pin/enforce Node version instead",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The SDD no longer relies on `engine-strict=false`. It instead aligns `packages/adapters` engines to Node 20 (the CI reality) and includes a validation/fallback path (if Node 22 is truly required, then upgrade CI). This resolves the prior truly-blocking risk."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "TS2835 “add .js extensions” is only correct for certain ESM/NodeNext setups; bulk change could break runtime/tests",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "SDD explicitly confirms `type: module` and `module/moduleResolution: NodeNext` for the affected packages and frames `.js` extension changes as correct under that configuration."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "ESLint builder exclusion might not be honored / could violate lint scope",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "SDD ties the exclusion to the exact lint invocation (`eslint src --ext .ts`), confirms no `--no-ignore`, and aligns with the PRD scope (builder excluded). This should behave in CI as intended."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Execution order applied breaking security upgrades before test stabilization, making attribution impossible",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Order now stabilizes tests before applying security patches, with `node-vault` (breaking) after a green baseline, which is the correct dependency ordering for attribution and rollback."
