  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "Yes—dropping the RFC 8785 claim and making `jq -Sc '.'` the explicitly non-JCS, project-normative canonicalization algorithm resolves the prior contradiction, and the rest of the previously-blocking items remain fixed with no new truly blocking issues introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Canonicalization rules were underspecified/unsafe (array ordering + string trimming) and could change semantics / destabilize hashes",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The SDD now cleanly specifies: no string mutation, arrays are deterministically ordered at extraction (not re-sorted in canonicalization), object keys sorted via jq, UTF-8/LF/no trailing newline, and SHA-256 over canonical bytes. Most importantly, it removes the RFC 8785 claim and states jq canonicalization is normative, eliminating the spec/implementation contradiction."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Golden vectors were inconsistent with the described extractor inputs (input.md vs codebase scan)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Vectors are now fixture directory trees that run through the same extractor path (scan repo structure → extract JSON → canonicalize → hash). This is implementable and consistent with the production pipeline."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Route extraction via grep would miss common Express patterns, producing incomplete route index",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The SDD specifies ts-morph AST parsing, mount resolution via router.use, and a baseline-count completeness gate, which addresses the completeness risk for the route index."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Citation model mismatch between syntax and validation/pinning (source: vs repo@version:path)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "A single machine-readable `<!-- cite: ... -->` format is defined and explicitly shared by both pinning and validation tooling."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Smoke tests assumed a JWT existed but did not specify how to obtain one locally",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The quick-start now includes an executable local auth flow (`gaib auth setup-dev` + `gaib auth token --dev`) plus a manual fallback, and the smoke-test protocol references `$JWT` from that flow."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Ecosystem stats relied on non-existent/undefined GitHub API data and vague caching",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Stats are computed via shallow clones at pinned refs + local cloc/test discovery with a concrete cache location, TTL, and `--fresh` override."
