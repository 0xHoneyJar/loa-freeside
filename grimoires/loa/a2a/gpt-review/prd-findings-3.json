  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "The previously blocking contradiction about event emission semantics is now resolved and the earlier fixes remain intact, with no new truly blocking issues introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Cross-system conservation check mixed money vs budget capacity without a defined bridge instrument/semantics (FR-10 + §9.3)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-9/FR-10 continue to clearly separate conserved funds (credit ledger) from authorized capacity (budget engine) and define the bridge as 1:1 locked credits via reserve()/finalize()/release(), with reconciliation equality checks."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Monotonic per-entity sequence_number requirement incompatible with async emission and multi-writer reality (FR-7/FR-8)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-7 uses SQLite rowid ordering and explicitly drops per-entity sequence numbers; FR-8 keeps synchronous in-transaction insertion, preserving atomicity and achievable ordering guarantees."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Agents don’t need KYC conflicted with creator KYC and payout/settlement beneficiary ambiguity (FR-1/FR-3)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3’s beneficiary model is consistent: agent is a controlled sub-ledger; creator is the legal beneficiary and payout destination; creator KYC governs thresholds."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Budget cap semantics undefined with reserve/finalize/release/TTL and concurrency (FR-2)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-2 defines cap accounting on finalized spend only, idempotent cap updates keyed by reservation_id, and atomic cap counter updates in the same SQLite transaction as finalize()."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Constitutional parameters + Redis caching risk inconsistent enforcement across nodes; missing versioning/activation semantics (FR-4/5/6 + NFR)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "NFR now requires SQLite-in-transaction reads for money-moving operations, Redis only for non-transactional reads, and includes config_version/active_from with recording of config_version in the audit trail; emergency override is multi-approval with audit notification."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "“Instant settlement” and “agents can’t dispute” ignored clawback/withhold flows and could create negative balances/invariant breaks (FR-1 + settlement policy)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-2b clarifies instant settlement as no human dispute window while retaining fraud withhold/clawback; it also specifies non-negative agent balances and shortfall handling."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Phase 1 provenance verification keyed to token_id conflicted with Phase 2 TBA binding; identity anchor mismatch risk (FR-11 vs FR-3)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3 establishes canonical identity anchor (chain_id, contract_address, token_id) with Phase 2 tba_address explicitly additive."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Contradiction: FR-8 requires synchronous in-transaction event emission while Risks section reintroduced async/fire-and-forget emission",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Section 8 now aligns with FR-8: synchronous INSERT into economic_events within the same SQLite transaction, with an async dispatcher only after commit for external publication (outbox pattern)."
