    {
      "original_issue": "Auth boundary between loa-freeside and loa-finn (S2S JWT ES256) was underspecified/inconsistent (JWKS hosting, rotation, internal-only vs public).",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Track 0 now clearly defines finn as internal-only, SG inbound only from freeside, JWKS hosted by freeside (issuer), explicit iss/aud/TTL, and a concrete rotation mechanism via Secrets Manager + scheduled Lambda. This is implementable on ECS and resolves the earlier inconsistency."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "NOWPayments webhook ingress not concretely defined for ALB/TLS + idempotency semantics ambiguous (risk double-mint).",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-1.2 specifies a stable public HTTPS endpoint on freeside, HMAC-SHA512 verification, and idempotency keyed on payment_id with a UNIQUE constraint and replay behavior (200/no extra credits). This is sufficient to prevent double-minting and aligns with the stated existing adapter assets."

    {
      "original_issue": "“Private to holder” Discord thread likely infeasible; permission model/fallback missing.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3.1 now uses public threads with bot-enforced gating by default, and private threads only when supported, with explicit fallback. This matches Discord constraints and is shippable."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Personality bridge ownership/call flow unclear and internally contradictory (dependencies/graph required a personality lookup endpoint despite stating finn derives personality inside inference).",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Track 2 is now consistent end-to-end: FR-2.1 explicitly says freeside passes nft_id/tier/budget_reservation_id in the S2S JWT and finn resolves personality/selects pool; dependencies no longer require a separate GET personality endpoint; the dependency graph nodes are updated to 'Inference request enrichment' and 'metadata headers'. This removes the integration-blocking mismatch."

    {
      "original_issue": "Web chat widget auth/gating undefined; risk of leaking API keys in browser or bypassing token gating.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3.6/FR-3.7 define SIWE → server-issued short-lived session token, explicitly forbid API keys in browser, and provide a server-side key option for embedded widgets plus read-only unauthenticated mode. This is a viable MVP security posture."

    {
      "original_issue": "Prometheus requirement lacked a viable ECS/Fargate scraping architecture.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-0.5 specifies AMP + ADOT collector sidecars with ECS task metadata discovery, retaining CloudWatch Container Insights. This is an AWS-supported pattern and meets the 60s alerting requirement in FR-0.7."
