  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All nine Flatline improvements appear integrated cleanly, FR-9/FR-10 are consistent with existing scope/acceptance gates, and no new truly blocking contradictions or impossible requirements were introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "FR-2 BUTTERFREEZONE hashing was underspecified and brittle (algorithm, normalization, validation reliability)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Now specifies SHA-256 plus a structured JSON extraction/canonicalization step (sorted keys, trimmed values, deterministic arrays, UTF-8), excludes the meta block to avoid circularity, and adds a reference implementation + golden test vectors + validate script. This closes the prior verification gap and reduces OS/whitespace brittleness."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "API docs scope/verification risk: too many endpoints to hand-document and keep accurate; missing enforceable contract and validation gate",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-4 is now explicitly constrained to 7 guaranteed-stable endpoints with full examples, while the remaining routes are covered via an auto-extracted route index (method/path/auth/description) and labeled internal/unstable. Smoke-test checklist remains the validation gate, which makes the quick-start verifiable against a local instance."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Auth ambiguity (JWT vs API keys) could lead to incorrect onboarding steps",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "JWT (ES256 + JWKS) remains the only auth method with operational steps; API keys are explicitly marked Planned with no operational steps. This stays consistent with the quick-start and acceptance criteria."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Security guidance missing for auth/keys/admin scoping (risk of shipping unsafe docs)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-4 acceptance criteria now explicitly requires security disclaimers (no private keys in code, dev/prod JWKS separation, rotation expectations, TTL guidance, aud/iss validation, least privilege, admin endpoint scoping). This is additive and does not contradict scope."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Docs would re-drift without ownership/maintenance triggers and cadence",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-9 introduces a DRI table, concrete update triggers mapped to code paths, doc versioning/errata expectations, and a weekly verification spot-check with a logging location. This is internally consistent with the RTFM validation gate and the overall 'docs-as-product' framing."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Execution plan lacked sequencing/gates, increasing risk of scope creep and missed launch window",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-10 adds a 5-phase 10-day plan with dependency order and explicit gates aligned to existing acceptance criteria (smoke tests, terraform plan, RTFM, naming grep, hash validation). Circuit breaker is consistent with the earlier staging-only IaC scope (it further reduces work rather than expanding it)."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Cross-repo truth-grounded citations were hard to keep stable and verifiable",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "NFR-1 now adds citation automation via scripts/pin-citations.sh to resolve repo@version:path into commit-SHA permalinks using gh api, while retaining the prohibition on branch links and the grep-based acceptance check. This improves maintainability without weakening the stability requirement."
