  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "The five v1.2.0 Flatline HIGH_CONSENSUS integrations are consistent with the established posting-level event model, BigInt-only economics, and RLS tenant isolation, and they do not introduce contradictions with existing acceptance criteria or new truly blocking risks.",

      "original_issue": "IMP-001: Governance rate limiting (per-role/per-community quotas in F-4)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Added explicit per-role daily quotas plus a per-community burst limit with Redis keys scoped by community_id and role, and made limits non-governable (prevents self-escalation). This does not create a governance deadlock because (a) admin remains unlimited, (b) limits are high enough for normal ops, and (c) 429 + Retry-After provides a deterministic recovery path rather than wedging state."

      "original_issue": "IMP-002: Sequence gaps on rollback (clarification in F-3 sequencing)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "PRD now explicitly states gaps are expected on rollback and consumers must tolerate them. This is consistent with the per-community counter-table allocation approach and does not break determinism: ordering is still strictly by (community_id, sequence_number) for committed rows."

      "original_issue": "IMP-003: Event sourcing snapshots/compaction/archival (lifecycle section in F-3)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Lifecycle section is compatible with posting-level canonicality: snapshots are derived state with a last_sequence_number pointer; compaction is explicitly deferred (no implementation this cycle), and archival preserves full-fidelity events for forensic replay. Nothing here requires an envelope model or violates append-only semantics."

      "original_issue": "IMP-004: Concurrent policy approvals (latest-wins, atomic supersession in F-4)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Defines latest-wins plus atomic supersession in a single transaction, with retry-on-conflict behavior. This does not violate conservation invariants because budget_limit decreases are still gated by the existing pending_enforcement rule (cannot enforce below committed+reserved), and policy activation is described as atomic with event logging."

    {
      "original_issue": "IMP-008: Aggregate scaling assumptions (community count, batching in NF-2)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Adds platform-wide assumptions and batching strategy that are coherent with the architecture: per-community sequencing serializes only within a tenant; velocity computation is scheduled and batched; and the stated contention threshold aligns with the earlier note about considering advisory locks only at high per-community TPS."
