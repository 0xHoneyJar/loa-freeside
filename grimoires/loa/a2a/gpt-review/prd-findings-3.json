  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "The revised PRD remains internally consistent and financially reconcilable, and it preserves the previously-fixed items (split math, bonus trigger/idempotency, withdrawability/backing, Score pool boundedness, identity binding, attribution anchoring/idempotency, and NOWPayments async+security) without introducing any new truly blocking issues.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Revenue-share math inconsistent vs existing governed 3-way split (referrer cut applied then 3-way split example changed effective shares)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3.2 still clearly defines the referrer as an off-the-top 4th slice and applies the 3-way split to the remainder; Section 9 example conserves value and specifies deterministic rounding with foundation absorbing remainder."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Signup bonus trigger contradictory (could imply two $5 bonuses) vs one-bonus rule",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-2.1/2.2 still enforce 'first qualifying action (dNFT OR purchase)' and one bonus per referee via uniqueness/idempotency; no double-trigger path remains."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Payout flow not reconcilable: unclear what credits represent, which are withdrawable, and how NOWPayments is funded/backed",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-6.4/6.5/6.6 continue to define withdrawable vs non-withdrawable pools, settlement gating, clawback bounded to pending, and a solvency invariant tying settled withdrawables to treasury:payout_reserve with atomic burn+reserve debit."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Score-weighted rewards pool liability not bounded / unclear funding source and withdrawability",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-5.2/5.3 cap pool size to available dedicated funding balance and enforce a hard budget; FR-5.4 keeps Score rewards non-withdrawable, preventing treasury liability."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Score identity resolution undefined and Sybil via wallet splitting not addressed",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-5.1 specifies EVM canonical identity with signature-based wallet linking and replay protection; FR-5.5 adds per-wallet/per-account thresholds to reduce wallet-splitting/dust attacks."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "12-month attribution window lacked precise anchor and idempotent finalization behavior",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3.3 anchors expiry to referral_registrations.created_at and checks eligibility at finalization; FR-3.4 keeps idempotency keyed by (inference_charge_id, rule_version)."

    {
      "original_issue": "NOWPayments payout execution mixed synchronous latency targets and lacked idempotency/webhook verification/fee handling",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-6.7/6.8/6.9 keep async execution via BullMQ, idempotency keying, HMAC-verified callbacks, and explicit gross/net/fee accounting; NFR-4 continues to exclude provider latency from API p99."
