{
  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "The v1.2.0 PRD keeps the original P0 launch blockers intact while correctly integrating the Flatline additions (determinism, JWKS security, network isolation, RTFM protocol, invariants) in a way that remains achievable in-repo with specific, testable acceptance criteria and no new blocking contradictions.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "E2E success criteria incorrectly relied on `docker compose up` rather than a deterministic test runner with teardown and exit code",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-1 still anchors on `tests/e2e/e2e-entrypoint.sh` with explicit timeouts (AC-1.8), trap-based teardown (AC-1.7), and exit-code semantics; this remains deterministic and measurable."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "CI/E2E topology ambiguously depended on external loa-finn repo via LOA_FINN_DIR, risking non-reproducible CI and fork failures",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-1/FR-7 continue to state stub-by-default and stub-in-CI with LOA_FINN_DIR as local-dev-only; no cross-repo dependency is assumed for success."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Redis isolation allowed skipping/mocking without defining which tests must still run, risking meaningless green CI or persistent red CI",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-2’s taxonomy + default `pnpm test` → unit-only (AC-2.4) and separate CI jobs for integration with Redis (AC-2.3) keeps NFR-4 achievable and prevents “green but meaningless” outcomes."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Economic loop E2E referenced payment flows without specifying how external providers are avoided, risking flaky/impossible CI",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-6’s external dependency policy + explicit zero-egress requirement (AC-6.1/6.5/6.6) keeps the loop test feasible and deterministic using only in-repo stubs/simulation."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "JWKS bootstrap and S2S JWT flow direction was underspecified and could be inverted vs reality",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-1 clearly defines issuer/audience direction and shared-volume JWKS bootstrap, and v1.2.0 strengthens it with public-only, ephemeral keys, atomic write, and a negative JWKS test (AC-1.9)."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Staging checklist required enumerating secrets but lacked an authoritative inventory source and measurable deployable verification",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-5 still ties inventory to Terraform variables + `.env.example` and includes measurable gates (`terraform plan` + `/health` 200) in AC-5.5."
