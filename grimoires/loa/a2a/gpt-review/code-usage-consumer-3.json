    {
      "original_issue": "micro-USD to cents conversion silently truncates fractional cents; must validate divisibility or fail",
      "status": "not_fixed",
      "notes": "The revised code now uses ceiling division to round up fractional cents rather than rejecting non-divisible values, which does not satisfy the requirement for exact conversion and boundary validation."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "If microUsdToCents throws, it must be classified as non-retryable terminal validation by including conversion in the validation block",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Conversion is now performed inside the same try/catch as parsing, so validation failures are handled as terminal."
