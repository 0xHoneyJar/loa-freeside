  "summary": "Most of the previously blocking contradictions were fixed (routes extraction approach, canonical-vs-implemented invariants, RTFM scope ownership, verify-routes probing, golden vectors policy, and findings closure), but one original blocker remains unresolved: Sprint 4 still hard-cites an `arrakis-*` code path while the plan also enforces a zero-tolerance naming gate, making the Sprint 4 gate potentially unachievable under the stated rules.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 4 ECONOMICS.md pre-flight cites old/forbidden `themes/sietch/src/packages/core/protocol/arrakis-conservation.ts` path, conflicting with naming policy",
      "status": "not_fixed",
      "notes": "The revised plan keeps the `arrakis-conservation.ts` path and adds a note: \"code-level renaming is explicitly out of scope... Citations to code paths may use the original filename.\" However, the global requirement and multiple gates still say \"Zero 'Arrakis' references\" and RTFM check #2 greps for \"arrakis\" across a zero-tolerance list that Sprint 5.1 expands to include ECONOMICS/EVENT-PROTOCOL (and Sprint 4.1 also requires zero Arrakis references). If ECONOMICS.md cites a path containing \"arrakis\", the doc will contain the substring and the naming grep will fail unless the naming rule explicitly exempts code-path citations or exempts this specific file. As written, this remains a gating deadlock risk."

      "original_issue": "Sprint 2.1 ts-morph AST vs Sprint 4.4 note claiming grep-based extractor (plan contradiction)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 2.1 now explicitly allows either ts-morph AST or a pragmatic grep-based matcher, with a requirement to document the chosen approach in the script header. Sprint 4.4’s coverage note is aligned to the actual grep-based implementation (and framed as 'actual implementation'). The contradiction is removed."

    {
      "original_issue": "Canonical 14 conservation properties vs freeside enforcing subset (Sprint 4/6/9 inconsistency)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 4.1 now states loa-hounfour is the normative canonical set (14), and freeside’s adapter list is 'implemented coverage'. Sprint 6.4 adds an explicit coverage note (N of 14 enforced). Sprint 9.1 requires a 14-row table referencing loa-hounfour. This creates a coherent reconciliation rule."

      "original_issue": "RTFM managed-doc scope ownership split/duplicated (GLOSSARY added twice; Sprint 10 dependency mismatch)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 8.3 is the introduction point for adding GLOSSARY.md to MANAGED_DOCS. Sprint 10.1 is now explicitly verification-only ('confirm already added; only change if incomplete') and includes an acceptance criterion 'No redundant MANAGED_DOCS additions'. This resolves the scope ownership ambiguity and removes the earlier dependency mismatch risk."

      "original_issue": "verify-routes.sh acceptance criteria unsafe/flaky (HEAD/GET on every route; non-idempotent routes; 405 handling)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 2.4 now constrains checks to indexed GET routes for auth validation, treats 405 as non-fatal for safe probes, adds per-route `probe_method` override, and forbids sending bodies to non-idempotent routes. This makes the gate testable and much less flaky."

      "original_issue": "Sprint 9 BUTTERFREEZONE discovery fields change lacks explicit golden vector/validator policy update",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 9.2 now explicitly requires: (a) validator updated so new fields are optional with advisory warning exit code 2, (b) RTFM check #7 accepts 0 or 2, and (c) golden vectors regenerated and committed. This closes the gate deadlock."

      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 10.4 adds a closure table artifact in `grimoires/loa/NOTES.md` (or dedicated section) mapping all 13 findings to sprint/task/doc section and validation evidence, with CLOSED/DEFERRED status rules. This is sufficient to prevent regression disputes at merge time."

      "description": "The plan simultaneously (a) requires ECONOMICS.md to cite a code path containing the substring `arrakis` and (b) enforces a zero-tolerance `grep -ci \"arrakis\"` naming gate across managed docs (expanded to include ECONOMICS.md). This can make Sprint 4/5/6/10 gates impossible to pass if the naming check is literal substring-based.",
      "why_blocking": "This is not stylistic: it can hard-fail required CI checks (RTFM check #2) and/or Sprint gates, preventing merge. The plan’s own acceptance criteria repeatedly require 'Zero \"Arrakis\" references' while also instructing inclusion of an `arrakis-*` citation string in a managed doc.",
      "fix": "Pick one explicit, testable reconciliation and encode it in the plan + validator:\n1) Preferred: rename the code file/module away from `arrakis-*` (and update imports) before Sprint 4 citations are written; OR\n2) If code rename is truly out of scope: update the naming policy and RTFM check #2 to exempt code-path citations (e.g., ignore text inside `<!-- cite: ... -->` blocks) or exempt this specific legacy filename, while still banning 'Arrakis' in prose. Then update Sprint 4.1/5.1 acceptance criteria to reflect the exemption so gates remain achievable."
