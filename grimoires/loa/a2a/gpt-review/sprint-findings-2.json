      "original_issue": "Task 1.3 assumed `jq` exists in the e2e runtime container but didn’t include an explicit task to add/verify it in the correct image/stage used by `tests/e2e/e2e-entrypoint.sh`.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.3 now explicitly adds/ensures `jq` in the E2E Docker image stage (prefers adding in e2e stage to keep production minimal), adds a `command -v jq` guard, and adds a verifiable check (`docker run --rm <e2e-image> jq --version`). This makes AC-1.3.5/1.3.6 testable and prevents runtime hard-fail if jq is absent."

    {
      "original_issue": "Task 2.1 used bash-specific `[[ ... ]]` and assumed `openssl` availability without a robust gate; risk of syntax error under `sh` and confusing failures under `set -e`.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.1 now states the script uses bash shebang already, avoids `[[` in the new TLS block (uses `case` + `[ ]`), and adds an explicit `command -v openssl` gate that WARNs and skips. AC-2.1.4 includes a concrete test (`PATH= bash ...`) to ensure it won’t crash when openssl is missing."

    {
      "original_issue": "Task 2.4 hardcoded an example short SHA/tag without a step to resolve the correct immutable reference; acceptance was unverifiable if the SHA/tag didn’t exist.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.4 now includes an explicit git-resolution step (find merge commit via grep, expand to full SHA, verify with `git cat-file -e`, and optionally resolve tags via `git tag --contains` / `git show-ref`). Acceptance criteria now require verifiable SHA/tag rather than a hardcoded placeholder."
