{
  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously blocking gaps (decision mechanism, graduation integration, criteria ambiguity, route inventory, FR-3/FR-4 coordination, startup fingerprint testability, and CI enforcement + version source for contracts) are addressed with implementable tasks and testable acceptance criteria, and no new truly blocking problems were introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "FR-6 naming lacked an explicit decision mechanism/owner/timebox; downstream tasks depended on the chosen name",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.1 now defines a concrete decision mechanism (AskUserQuestion during implementation) plus an explicit fallback default (Commons Protocol) if no response, which unblocks Sprint 1 completion and downstream references."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "FR-1 graduation added a gauge but didn’t wire evaluator into the runtime metrics update path",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.4 explicitly identifies the integration point (existing parseBoundaryMicroUsd metrics emitter), requires calling evaluateGraduation() on the same cadence, and includes an integration test asserting gauge 0→1 transition."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Ambiguity/contradiction around zero-traffic rule vs 7-day observation and 72h consecutive clean windows",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.2 now states the explicit rule: shadowTotal==0 vacuously satisfies divergence only, but time windows still must elapse; Task 1.3 includes a matching test."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "FR-3 route integration lacked an inventory/checklist to ensure all micro-USD entry points were updated",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.2 adds an explicit grep-based inventory step, classification (user-facing vs internal-only), and requires the checklist be included in the PR description, closing the partial-rollout risk."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "FR-3 schema mode-awareness via resolveParseMode() wasn’t coordinated with FR-4 cold-restart/module-level caching constraints",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.1 now explicitly states the coordination: schema mode fixed at process start via resolveParseMode() module cache, and adds a test asserting schema mode matches resolveParseMode() under controlled env."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "FR-4 fingerprint emission test was underspecified/likely flaky without a defined harness",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.5 specifies a deterministic approach: refactor emitConfigFingerprint() to accept an injected logger and test via a mock logger, including non-leakage assertions."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "FR-2 contract testing lacked CI wiring/enforcement; contract could exist but not prevent drift",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 3.4 explicitly adds a verification test and requires inclusion in standard pnpm test/CI discovery so CI fails on entrypoint drift or vectors hash mismatch."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "FR-2 provider version range (>=7.9.2) wasn’t tied to a source of truth or validated",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 3.1 defines the source as the installed @0xhoneyjar/loa-hounfour version in package.json, and Task 3.4 adds a test validating the semver floor against the installed version."
