    {
      "original_issue": "Task 3.2 mixed CI-implementable code/DB work with untestable ops/infra deliverables (pgaudit/CloudWatch/cron/SLOs), making DoD unachievable",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "3.2 is now explicitly code+DB-migration only with CI-provable acceptance criteria, and ops/infra moved to 3.3 as a non-blocking deployment ticket with clear deliverables."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Partitioning plan was ambiguous/incorrectly described (\"partition trigger inheritance\"), risking runtime insert failures when partitions are missing",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Now specifies native RANGE partitioning on created_at plus a DEFAULT partition safety net, an idempotent SQL partition-creation function, and both scheduled job + CI headroom gate. This removes the outage mode and is implementable."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "GovernedMutationService coupling requirement lacked explicit scope (tables/write paths), making it impossible to prove all governed writes route through the service",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Adds an explicit governed write-path inventory (credit_lots, credit_reservations, agent_reputation), excludes non-governed tables, and includes acceptance/tests for routing and for direct updates failing."

      "original_issue": "Sprint 2 Task 2.2 depended on Sprint 3 FR-6 audit trail without a port/stub, creating a cross-sprint blocker",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Audit emission removed from 2.2, AuditTrailPort introduced with fail-closed stub behavior, and real wiring deferred to Sprint 4 integration—unblocks Sprint 2 while preserving fail-closed semantics."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Integration tests did not cover several DB-enforced invariants required by Task 3.2 (RLS/privileges, triggers, uniqueness, skew, idempotency), risking unverified life-critical properties",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 4.2 adds a DB harness that provisions roles/migrations/RLS/triggers and enumerates 13 scenarios explicitly covering the previously-missing invariants, including privilege/RLS/trigger enforcement, cross-partition uniqueness, skew constraint, and idempotency."
