    {
      "original_issue": "Missing explicit inventory of canonical identifiers prior to stateful imports, risking forced replacement/drift and blocking 0-change plan",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.0 now inventories all key identifiers and explicitly requires 1.1 HCL to use exact values, aligning pre-import and post-import expectations."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Bootstrap Redis auth script dependency unclear and idempotency underspecified (create vs update secret; when to run relative to import)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.2 now depends on replication group existing and being imported, specifies required inputs, create-or-update behavior, and explicit idempotency/no-op logic."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Health gates lacked a defined metric contract; alarms alone don’t guarantee deploy-ring.sh can compute/validate p99 and 5xx",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.2 defines metric sources and requires non-empty CloudWatch datapoints, plus documents the contract; deploy-ring.sh is correctly dependent on 2.2."

    {
      "original_issue": "Invalid DNS validation using literal wildcard dig query",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 3.4 now queries a concrete name (test.agents...) and includes additional authoritative checks for agents and ACME delegation."

      "original_issue": "Registrar (Gandi) access not confirmed early, risking late-stage cutover/DNSSEC blockage",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 4.0 explicitly verifies NS edit capability, record export, DS management, and documents SLA and access/MFA confirmation."

    {
      "original_issue": "Flatline findings SKP/IMP coverage not fully traceable (missing mappings for several IMP items)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Traceability table now maps SKP-001..004 and IMP-001..010, including IMP-003/005/006/010, and states none are out of scope."

      "original_issue": "Risk mitigations referenced inconsistent/possibly incorrect SDD sections for import workflow and rollback",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Risk table now includes an explicit SDD Reference column with normalized §4.2/§4.3/§4.4 references and aligns with Sprint 1 import AC."
