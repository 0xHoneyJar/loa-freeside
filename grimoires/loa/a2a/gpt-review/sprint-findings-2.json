  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously-blocking gaps (per-package lockfiles including core, sietch build parity, lint/scope verification, security scope + node-vault contingency compliance, and Dockerfile install/lockfile alignment) are addressed with concrete acceptance criteria and no new blocking issues introduced.",

    {
      "original_issue": "Core lockfile/install path missing despite per-package `npm ci`",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.1 now explicitly regenerates `packages/core` lockfile and verifies `npm ci` succeeds in core/adapters/sietch."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Sietch build not required (only `tsc --noEmit`), risking Build gate failure",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.2 now requires `npm run build` for `themes/sietch` and keeps `tsc --noEmit` as an additional check, matching PRD criteria."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "ESLint plan assumed ignore behavior and didn’t mirror CI invocation / repo scope",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.3 explicitly states CI lint runs only in sietch with `working-directory: ./themes/sietch`, mirrors the exact command (`npm run lint` -> `eslint src --ext .ts`), and includes AC to confirm scope and `.eslintignore` behavior."

      "original_issue": "Security remediation scoped only to sietch without acknowledging per-package gates",
      "status": "rejected_with_valid_reason",
      "notes": "The revised plan explicitly asserts (and makes an AC) that CI Security Scan is sietch-only via workflow `working-directory`. Given that constraint, limiting remediation to sietch is acceptable for getting required checks green and meeting PRD success criteria as written."

    {
      "original_issue": "node-vault contingency could violate zero high/critical requirement",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.2 contingency is now explicitly conditional on `npm audit --audit-level=high` exiting 0; otherwise the major upgrade must be completed within Sprint 2."

    {
      "original_issue": "Docker build task lacked explicit alignment with per-package lockfiles and Node version",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.4 now requires verifying base image `node:20-alpine` and that Docker runs per-package `npm ci` with correct lockfiles in build context, covering the common failure mode."
