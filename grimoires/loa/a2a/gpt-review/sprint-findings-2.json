  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously blocking inconsistencies were addressed with concrete gating, deterministic artifact verification, an exports-map audit, non-contradictory barrel criteria, CI-verifiable ops artifacts, and corrected kill-switch acceptance criteria; no new truly blocking issues introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 1 allowed temporary `any` stubs with no explicit removal gate, risking later work building on incorrect types",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "AC-1.1.4 now requires tsc passes with zero `any` stubs and only allows deferral when it explicitly requires barrel expansion, with a tracked follow-up prerequisite into Task 2.1. This closes the “temporary becomes permanent” failure mode."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Supply-chain rebuild/verification was not artifact-bound/deterministic; `npm ci --ignore-scripts` could prevent dist build; DIST_HASH recipe non-deterministic without SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH/canonicalization",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.2 now specifies a two-phase install/build, sets SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, pins Node via .nvmrc, and computes DIST_HASH from an `npm pack` tarball hash (artifact-bound and normalized). CI verification is added in Task 1.4. This is now reproducible and verifiable in principle."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "No explicit confirmation of actual v7.9.2 exports map / conditions; risk TS compiles but Node runtime fails due to exports/conditions mismatch",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.0 adds an explicit exports-map audit with documented conditions and tooling alignment, and Task 2.2 adds a runtime import validation test to catch TS-vs-runtime mismatches."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Barrel scope contradiction: 'only consumed symbols' vs 'export ~60 symbols' created untestable AC",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "AC-2.1.8 now defines a measurable rule: export the SDD §3.3 set, run and commit a consumption audit, and only remove zero-consumer symbols if not required by FRs in this cycle. This resolves the contradiction and makes reviewable completion criteria."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "PagerDuty/dashboard work lacked CI-verifiable acceptance and wiring to actual metrics backend; could block sprint completion on external config",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 4 splits into 4.2 (code-level instrumentation with unit/integration tests) and 4.2b (repo-based ops artifacts with lint/validate or an explicit external PR link). This makes the work mergeable and verifiable."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Kill-switch AC required boundary entry points to use BigInt directly, conflicting with wrapper-based design and making AC impossible post-migration",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 4.6 now correctly asserts legacy mode behavior via the wrapper and uses a spy/counter to ensure canonical `parseMicroUsd` is not consulted (call count 0), matching the intended kill-switch semantics."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "FR sequencing lacked an explicit gate requiring conformance + golden baseline replay to be green before boundary hardening (FR-6)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 4 now has an explicit CI entry gate requiring Sprint 1 golden replay + Sprint 2 conformance + semantic invariants to be green before starting boundary hardening, aligning with the dependency/rollback strategy."
