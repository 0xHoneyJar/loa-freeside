      "original_issue": "Compose depended on an unspecified/missing arrakis Dockerfile `e2e` target and on LOA_FINN_DIR being available, but neither prerequisite was captured",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.0 explicitly adds/verifies the Dockerfile `e2e` target with build/run/JWKS export ACs, and Task 1.1 now states LOA_FINN_DIR is an absolute path set by the runner plus includes `docker compose build` success criteria."

    {
      "original_issue": "Runner clones loa-finn at pinned SHA but compose builds from `${LOA_FINN_DIR}`; contract between script and compose was undefined/untestable",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.2 defines the runner as the single source of truth, exports LOA_FINN_DIR as an absolute path, and invokes compose after exporting it; Task 1.1 ACs validate compose config/build with LOA_FINN_DIR set."

      "original_issue": "NFR-1 timing (<5 min) was ambiguous and lacked a measurement boundary; could fail due to clone/build time",

      "notes": "Task 1.4 clarifies warm-cache expectation (<3 min with SKIP_BUILD=1) and explicitly allows cold build to exceed; Task 1.2 adds timing summary output to make it measurable."

      "original_issue": "Staging validation required CloudWatch but IAM permissions/region/log group/metric discovery were unspecified, making ACs potentially unexecutable",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.1 now specifies `--region` behavior, hardcoded log group and metric namespace (tied to Terraform/EMF), minimal IAM actions, and requires actionable error output on permission failures; idle datapoints behavior is defined as WARN."

    {
      "original_issue": "Goal G-2 was 'Automate staging verification' but goal check only covered localhost; no planned staging execution/verification",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.3 adds Part B staging execution and SC-2b explicitly covers staging-tier behavior (PASS/WARN) and also defines the fallback behavior if staging is unavailable (clear FAIL + documented command)."

    {
      "original_issue": "Conflict: risk mitigation said auto-generate dev keypair if missing, but Task 2.1 AC said missing `--test-key` skips invoke check with warning",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Appendix C and Task 2.1 AC-2.5 are aligned to the skip-with-WARN behavior; auto-generation is removed."
