  "verdict": "APPROVED",

    {
      "original_issue": "Version pin immutability mismatch between Task 1.1 and Success Criteria #1 (ranges not immutable; DIST_HASH reproducibility risk)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.1 AC now explicitly requires an exact pin (no ^/~), lockfile update, and clean reinstall DIST_HASH reproducibility; Success Criteria #1 was updated to match. This satisfies the supply-chain determinism intent."

    {
      "original_issue": "NativeEnforcement re-export planned in 1.4 but not included in 1.2 export verification gate (could export non-existent/type-only symbol)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.2 now includes explicit verification for NativeEnforcement with a type-only note and a rule to keep type-only items out of contract.json. The added export mapping table artifact also prevents future ambiguity."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Task 2.2 (bundle hash recomputation) lacked explicit dependency on Task 2.1 though both edit contract.json (merge/overwrite risk)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.2 now depends on 2.1 and includes an AC requiring validate.mjs to pass after both changes in the final contract.json state, which closes the sequencing/consistency gap."

    {
      "original_issue": "Task 2.4 identity check was underspecified (how to assert identity; runtime vs type-only; duplicate module instance risk)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Layer 1 now specifies reference-equality assertions with explicit import paths, adds a negative assertion against the governance subpath schema, and adds a single-resolved-copy precondition (pnpm dedup). The fallback to Layer 2 if schema is type-only is a reasonable, non-blocking contingency."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Task 1.3 lacked a concrete constraint on what must be barrel-exported vs contract-listed, risking non-aliased governance exports and collisions",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.3 now explicitly forbids unaliased governance TaskType/ReputationEvent exports and uses the Task 1.2 export mapping table as the authoritative source for barrel vs contract actions, which makes the governance surface controllable and reviewable."
