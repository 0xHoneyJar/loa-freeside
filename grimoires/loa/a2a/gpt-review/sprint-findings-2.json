  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All five previously-blocking dependency/validation gaps are addressed with concrete harnesses, canonical sources, and executable validators, and the plan is now runnable end-to-end with no new truly blocking issues introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 2 gate required `terraform plan` clean but no runnable Terraform harness/invocation/environment was defined",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "S305-T6 now explicitly adds `scripts/tf-plan.sh`, pins the module directory (`infrastructure/terraform/`), uses `terraform init -backend=false`, provides `terraform.tfvars.example` with dummy values, and defines the gate as 'exits 0 locally without AWS creds'. This resolves the original risk of the gate failing for non-doc reasons."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "API docs/tests depended on '7 guaranteed-stable endpoints' but there was no canonical locked list before writing docs and smoke tests",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "S305-T0 creates `docs/api/stable-endpoints.json` as the single source of truth and requires verification that each endpoint exists and is used to generate the smoke checklist and referenced by QUICKSTART/REFERENCE. This removes ambiguity and makes Sprint 2 gate verifiable."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Tier 2 contract checks required framework-specific runtime introspection (`app._router.stack`) which may be impossible",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "S305-T4 is now framework-agnostic via HTTP checks against a running dev server, with optional `/api/debug/routes` cross-check only if available. This eliminates the 'impossible depending on framework/export' failure mode."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "RTFM validation was a Sprint 3 gate but the plan did not include implementing/confirming the validator tooling",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "S306-T4 now explicitly creates `scripts/rtfm-validate.sh` and enumerates all 8 checks with deterministic exit behavior and a required passing run. This makes the Sprint 3 gate achievable and testable."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "BUTTERFREEZONE regeneration required jq >= 1.7 but jq availability/CI provisioning was not defined",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Prerequisites now specify jq >=1.7 installation paths (brew/apt/asdf/mise), require CI runner compliance, and scripts fail fast with exit 13 if unmet. This addresses the environment mismatch that could block Sprint 1."
