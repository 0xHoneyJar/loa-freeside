  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously blocking issues are addressed with concrete resequencing, explicit non-withdrawable pool enforcement, clarified Phase 1A vs 1B semantics, defined manual review operations, implemented cleanup jobs before validation, and an idempotent treasury seed approach—no new blocking problems introduced.",

    {
      "original_issue": "Migration numbering/order inconsistent (046 before 043; violated monotonic ordering requirement)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Migrations are now strictly monotonic and aligned to sprint order: 042 (S1) → 043 (S2) → 044 (S3) → 045 (S8) → 046 (S11). Dependency diagram and references match."

      "original_issue": "CampaignAdapter/pool isolation for `referral:signup` non-withdrawable not explicitly implemented/tested",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 3.4 explicitly registers pool IDs, configures `referral:signup` and `score:rewards` as non-withdrawable, verifies CampaignAdapter recognition, and adds an automated test proving exclusion from withdrawable queries."

    {
      "original_issue": "Phase 1A 'non-withdrawable' contradicted by Sprint 6/7 withdrawable semantics",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 6 now explicitly labels Phase 1A as `settled_available_micro` (non-withdrawable) and defers the withdrawable concept to Phase 1B (Sprint 9). The dashboard and query ACs reflect this boundary."

    {
      "original_issue": "Manual review queue referenced but not defined (no persistence/surfacing/approve-deny flow)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 4.5 defines storage fields, admin list endpoint, approve/deny endpoints, and an integration test covering both flows with correct CampaignAdapter/ledger behavior."

    {
      "original_issue": "Cleanup validation existed without earlier implementation tasks (nonce cleanup + referral_events retention)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Referral events retention cleanup is implemented in Sprint 7.5 and nonce cleanup in Sprint 11.4; Sprint 13.3 now correctly validates those implemented crons."

    {
      "original_issue": "Treasury account creation in migration not concretely specified/idempotent across environments",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 8.1 specifies a deterministic SQL seed using `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and adds an explicit AC that running the migration twice yields exactly one treasury account with the expected entity_id."
