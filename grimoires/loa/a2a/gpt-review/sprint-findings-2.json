      "original_issue": "Critical path shows 301.4 feeding into 301.5, but Task 301.5 did not depend on 301.4 (diagram inconsistent with task graph).",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 301.5 now explicitly depends on 301.4, and Appendix B depicts 301.4 joining into 301.5, so sequencing is unambiguous and consistent."

    {
      "original_issue": "301.5 snapshot acceptance criteria required an exact pre-migration copy but didn’t guarantee the source file still existed or was anchored to the tag.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "301.5 now mechanically generates the frozen snapshot from `pre-v7-migration-anchor` via `git show ... > frozen-conservation-evaluator.ts` and requires embedding the source SHA in the header, making it reproducible and provably pre-migration."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "302.1 dual-run acceptance criteria contradicted itself by allowing a KNOWN_DIFFS allowlist but also requiring zero unexpired allowlist entries.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Criteria now clearly allow KNOWN_DIFFS during Sprint 302 and moves the “must be empty” requirement to the final gate (303.6), removing the deadlock."

    {
      "original_issue": "303.6 test count math was non-verifiable (25+ new, 3 deleted) without enumerating deletions/additions.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Appendix D now enumerates new test files with minimum test counts and explicitly identifies the 3 deleted assertions (hash-pinning assertions removed in 301.3). Net math is now checkable."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "300.2 uses GitHub SHA install, but 303.1 Layer 2 required package version + gitHead match, which may be impossible if gitHead absent.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "303.1 Layer 2 is now conditional: assert gitHead only if present; otherwise assert the lockfile/npm resolution contains the expected SHA. This is deterministic for GitHub SHA installs."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "301.5 vs 303.5 duplicated ownership of `core/protocol/index.ts` rewrite, creating ambiguity/merge risk.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Plan now makes 301.5 the single-owner rewrite and 303.5 a verify/adjust task post-audit, which resolves the duplication."
