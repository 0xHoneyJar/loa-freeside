      "original_issue": "Findings JSON had `findings: []` but claimed a nonzero resolved count without listing the resolved finding in a machine-readable way",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "JSON now includes a `resolved_findings` array containing `medium-3` with `status: resolved`, `resolved_in_iteration: 3`, and concrete evidence (file/line/commit/before/after). `by_status.resolved: 1` now matches the array."

      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Final State rollups are now derivable from the provided history: medium findings are explicitly '1 from iter-2' and critical/high are 0. The unsupported 3/3 and 2/2 claims are removed."

      "original_issue": "Approval/Metadata statistics did not reconcile (e.g., '7 actionable' vs iter summaries of 4 actionable in iter-1 and 1 actionable in iter-2)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Totals are now consistent with the stated iteration context: total findings 10 (9+1) and actionable resolved 5 (4+1). Resolution rate 100% (5/5) is now auditable from the table."

      "notes": "A minimal diff hunk is included showing `+3600` → `+300`, and timestamp is now a concrete value (`2026-02-15T15:30:00Z`). Evidence is also duplicated in the resolved finding JSON."

      "original_issue": "Flatline detection was misapplied (rule stated two consecutive iterations < 2.0, but iter-2 score was 3.0)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The document no longer asserts 'FLATLINE DETECTED' under the two-iteration rule; it instead states quality gate passed and convergence achieved at final score 0.0, which matches the provided history."
