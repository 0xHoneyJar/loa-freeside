      "original_issue": "Task 1.1 ACs were internally inconsistent about which control characters are targeted vs the provided regex, risking wrong error-code classification and whitespace-test regressions.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The plan now explicitly pins the whitespace regex to `/[\\t\\n\\r\\f\\v ]/` (the exact 6 chars) and defines the control-char set as the complement: `\\x00-\\x08`, `\\x0E-\\x1F`, `\\x7F`, with regex `/[\\x00-\\x08\\x0E-\\x1F\\x7F]/`. It also adds a partitioning test ensuring \\t/\\n/\\r/\\f/\\v map to SAFETY_WHITESPACE while nearby controls map to SAFETY_CONTROL_CHAR, which directly addresses the earlier ambiguity/churn risk."

    {
      "original_issue": "Task 1.5 AC-1.5.2 used an incorrect hardcoded `'1'.repeat(15)` example and incorrect numeric equivalence, which could keep the test failing depending on MAX_SAFE_MICRO_USD.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "AC-1.5.2 now derives the test input from the constant (`String(MAX_SAFE_MICRO_USD)`) and adds a just-below-boundary test (`String(MAX_SAFE_MICRO_USD - 1n)`), making the expectation CI-verifiable and immune to future constant changes."
