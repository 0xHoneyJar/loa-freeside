      "original_issue": "Inconsistent/likely incorrect test file locations between Sprints 1/2 and Sprint 4",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 1 Task 1.3 and Sprint 2 Task 2.3 now place tests in `themes/sietch/tests/unit/...`, matching Sprint 4 and Sprint 3 Task 3.4. This removes the CI/test discovery risk and the false-green risk for Sprint 4’s closure tests."

      "original_issue": "MEDIUM-2 deferral needed an explicit deliverable (recorded with justification + follow-up pointer)",

      "original_issue": "Mode consistency testability gap due to module-level caching of resolveParseMode()",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 4 Task 4.2 specifies exporting and using `resetParseModeCache()` to make the mode-matrix test deterministic without relying on module reload/worker isolation, which is consistent with the cold-restart caching constraint."

      "original_issue": "Clock-skew warning task was too line/implementation-specific rather than behavior-based",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 4 Task 4.1 acceptance criteria are behavior-based (when `now < deployTimestamp`, treat elapsed as 0 and emit a warning via return type), preserving purity and testability without prescribing a specific clamp implementation."
