  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously blocking contradictions and feasibility gaps were addressed with explicit alignment to the actual required CI gates, a consistent security bar, a concrete Node-engine mitigation, and clear quarantine/rollback boundaries—without introducing new blocking risks.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Security target inconsistent (G-2 vs Success Criteria) and Security Scan tool unspecified",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "G-2 and Success Criteria now consistently target `npm audit --audit-level=high` == 0 (allowing moderates), and the PRD explicitly states the Security Scan check is `npm audit --audit-level=high` confirmed from the workflow. This removes the merge-gate ambiguity."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Node 20 in CI vs adapters engine >=22 mismatch relied on implicit ignore-engines behavior",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The PRD now makes an explicit, implementable decision: set `engine-strict=false` in CI npm config for the adapters install step and document it. This is concrete and aligns with the success criteria (i.e., installs won’t unexpectedly hard-fail due to engines)."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Single-cycle feasibility risk from committing to multiple breaking upgrades plus full lint/TS/test cleanup with no fallback",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "A contingency plan is now explicitly in-scope: timebox-based rollback via resolution overrides/pinning if a breaking upgrade destabilizes beyond a threshold, while still meeting the required Security Scan bar. Delivery strategy also allows staged PRs (MVP first, security second), preserving mergeability within the cycle."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Docker Build required check omitted from success criteria and potentially out-of-scope fixes",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Docker Build is now included in Goals (G-1), constraints, and Success Criteria (all 5 checks green). Scope explicitly allows minimal Dockerfile changes if needed, removing the prior 'can’t merge even if everything else is green' failure mode."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Contradictory test scope: 'no new tests' vs test infra fixes; skipping tests loophole vs goal of 0 failing files",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The PRD now clearly allows minimal test helpers/fixtures for existing tests, and defines quarantining as an explicit, tracked mechanism with expiry. G-3 and Success Criteria are aligned around 'non-quarantined' tests, closing the loophole while keeping feasibility."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Lint scope mismatch: repo-wide '0 errors' implied while builder excluded; risk CI lint still covers builder",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "G-4 and Success Criteria now explicitly define the lint target as 'linted paths' with `src/ui/builder/` excluded via `.eslintignore`. This aligns the metric with the intended gate behavior."
