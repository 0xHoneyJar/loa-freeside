    {
      "original_issue": "Contradictory versioning strategy: semver range (^7.0.0) vs GitHub tag installs",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "G-1/FR-1 now explicitly target GitHub tag v7.0.0, assert CONTRACT_VERSION === '7.0.0', and require lockfile commit SHA recording—consistent with the GitHub-install constraint."

    {
      "original_issue": "“Zero runtime regressions / invisible to production” conflicted with wire-visible schema changes and Phase 4 being out of scope",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Reframed to 'zero arrakis-internal regressions' and explicitly states boundary changes are version-gated with backward compatibility during transition (NFR-2, G-6, Success #9). This is now enforceable within Phase 3 via boundary tests."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Priority mismatch: breaking-change handling was P0 goal but FRs were P1; unsafe reliance on grep for trust_scopes impact",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-5 and FR-6 are now P0 and explicitly call out that grep is insufficient; they require JWT/coordination schema audits and encode/decode + compat tests."

    {
      "original_issue": "Semver-based drift detection incorrect/underspecified under GitHub tag installs; CONTRACT_VERSION alone doesn’t detect retagging",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-7 now requires a two-layer assertion: CONTRACT_VERSION exact match plus lockfile-resolved commit SHA match to an expected constant, with an explicit upgrade procedure."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Test-count preservation conflicted with deleting redundant equivalence/hash tests; replacement tests not specified",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "NFR-4 is now coverage-based for protocol modules and explicitly defines 1:1 replacements for the specific deleted tests; also preserves the 32 property tests and 14 conformance assertions."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Conservation equivalence not defined/measurable; risk of changing the oracle to match canonical and masking regressions",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3 now mandates freezing the local evaluator for test-only dual-run, running identical generated traces through both, failing on any unenumerated disagreement, plus adding an evaluator-independent conserved-quantity property test."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Version negotiation acceptance criteria ambiguous; could implement wrong behavior for Phase 3 interop",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-6 now defines concrete Phase 3 negotiation behavior (supported range, preferred version) and requires inbound acceptance for both v4.6.0 and v7.0.0 formats with explicit tests."
