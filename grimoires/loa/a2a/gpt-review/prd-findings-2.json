{
  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All seven previously-blocking contradictions/verification gaps were addressed with concrete contracts, measurement/validation methods, and scoped acceptance criteria, and the changes did not introduce any new truly blocking issues.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "API Quick-Start/Reference requirements were unverifiable due to missing public contract (base URL/env, credential issuance, streaming protocol, public vs admin endpoints, smoke tests)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The PRD now includes a clear Developer-Facing API Contract (localhost:3000 target, JWT ES256+JWKS, SSE, endpoint classification, credential acquisition paths) plus an explicit curl-based smoke-test checklist as a validation gate."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Auth method ambiguity (JWT vs API keys) risked shipping incorrect onboarding steps",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "JWT (ES256 + JWKS) is declared primary with operational steps; API keys are explicitly marked Planned with no operational steps, aligning with the quick-start and acceptance criteria."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Ecosystem stats (LOC/tests/versions) lacked a defined measurement method and would drift / be unverifiable",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "A canonical measurement approach is specified (cloc + test runner output), with required generated_at + commit SHA/tag anchoring and acceptance criteria tying published numbers to script output."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "BUTTERFREEZONE content hashes were underspecified (algorithm, file set/normalization, validation mode), making validation unreliable",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Hashing is now defined as SHA-256, per-section hashing, normalization rules, explicit exclusion of the meta block, and a validation mode tied to the generating commit/working tree at generation time."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Naming migration policy was contradictory (zero Arrakis vs theme references) and lacked enforceable boundaries",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The PRD now enumerates zero-tolerance files, exempt/theme directories, and a single-mention historical pattern, with a grep-based validation command integrated into FR-8."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "IaC acceptance implied production-grade deploy while production deployment was out of scope",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Scope is narrowed to staging/non-production deployment with production hardening as checklist-only; acceptance criteria are aligned (staging deployability + terraform plan validation)."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Truth-grounded citation requirement was impossible for cross-repo claims without stable link rules",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Cross-repo citation rules now require tags or commit-SHA permalinks and prohibit branch links, with a grep-based acceptance check to prevent drift/link rot."
