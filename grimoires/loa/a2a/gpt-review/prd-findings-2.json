    {
      "original_issue": "NFR-2 (Additive Only) conflicted with FR-4 (evaluation geometry) and FR-2 (hash chain verification) implying runtime behavior changes",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "NFR-2 now explicitly constrains the cycle to schema-only adoption; FR-2 AC-2.4 is utility-only (no chain construction/verification) and FR-4 ACs explicitly state re-export only / no runtime behavior change."

      "original_issue": "ADR-001 aliasing ambiguity: barrel re-exporting both aliased and unaliased governance names would reintroduce collisions/type identity drift",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3 AC-3.1 now requires ONLY aliased Governance* variants at the protocol barrel and explicitly forbids re-exporting unaliased governance TaskType/ReputationEvent at the barrel level; this resolves the collision risk cleanly."

    {
      "original_issue": "Contract versioning strategy was underspecified and could break convergence (provider_version_range bump vs 'strict superset' and unclear contract subject)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-5 now clearly defines the contract subject (freeside barrel imports asserted against hounfour provider), declares the provider_version_range bump to >=7.11.0 as deliberate, and adds AC-5.6 to enforce strict superset of prior entrypoints."

      "original_issue": "Version pin contradiction: requirement said 'tag not SHA' but risk mitigation allowed SHA fallback",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-6 now enumerates acceptable immutable references, bans untagged SHAs, and makes failure to resolve tag/npm a blocker with escalation rather than silent SHA fallback."

    {
      "original_issue": "Open TaskType union could break closed-world assumptions downstream even if upstream change is additive",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-1 adds an explicit closed-world audit statement and AC-1.6/AC-1.5 constrain this cycle to schema-only re-export without introducing governance TaskType into routing/mapping/switch logic, preventing accidental behavioral/validation breakage."
