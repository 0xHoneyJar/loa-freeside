  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously blocking inconsistencies (split math, signup bonus trigger, credit backing/withdrawability, Score pool liability, identity binding, attribution anchoring/idempotency, and NOWPayments async+security) are addressed in a way that is implementable and financially reconcilable.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Revenue-share math inconsistent vs existing governed 3-way split (referrer cut applied then 3-way split example changed effective shares)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3.2 explicitly chooses the model: referrer is a 4th slice taken off the top, and the 3-way split is redefined as % of the remainder when a referrer is present; Section 9 example matches and adds a conservation invariant with deterministic rounding (foundation absorbs remainder)."

    {
      "original_issue": "Signup bonus trigger contradictory (could imply two $5 bonuses) vs one-bonus rule",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-2.1 clarifies first qualifying action (dNFT OR first purchase, whichever first) and FR-2.2 enforces one bonus per referee with idempotency/uniqueness; user journey now aligns."

      "original_issue": "Payout flow not reconcilable: unclear what credits represent, which are withdrawable, and how NOWPayments is funded/backed",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-6.4 defines withdrawable vs non-withdrawable credit classes via pool tags; FR-6.5 introduces a treasury reserve backing model and a solvency invariant tying withdrawable balances to treasury:payout_reserve; FR-6.6 makes payout an atomic burn + treasury debit."

      "original_issue": "Score-weighted rewards pool liability not bounded / unclear funding source and withdrawability",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-5.2/5.3 hard-cap pool size to min(config, available balance) and require a dedicated funding account/pool with enforcement; FR-5.4 makes Score rewards non-withdrawable, preventing treasury drain."

    {
      "original_issue": "Score identity resolution undefined and Sybil via wallet splitting not addressed",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-5.1 defines canonical identifier as EVM address, requires wallet linking with signature verification, and accrues per-account across linked wallets; FR-5.5 adds per-wallet and per-account minimum thresholds to mitigate wallet-splitting/dust."

    {
      "original_issue": "12-month attribution window lacked precise anchor and idempotent finalization behavior",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3.3 anchors expiry to referral_registrations.created_at and specifies the eligibility check at finalization; FR-3.4 adds idempotency keyed by (inference_charge_id, rule_version) to prevent replay/backfill double-pay."

      "original_issue": "NOWPayments payout execution mixed synchronous latency targets and lacked idempotency/webhook verification/fee handling",
