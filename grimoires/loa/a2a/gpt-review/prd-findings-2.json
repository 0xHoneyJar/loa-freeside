  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously blocking inconsistencies (auth, tenancy, billing primitive, dogfood gating, contract source of truth, SLA language, and BYOK metering) are now explicitly surfaced as decisions with coherent recommended paths, and no new truly blocking issues were introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Auth model contradictory (JWT/JWKS vs API keys) causing onboarding/SDK/CLI ambiguity",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Added D1 with clear options (API key primary, OAuth/OIDC primary, hybrid) and an explicit recommended hybrid pattern (API key for S2S + OAuth for portal) mapping both to internal JWT. This resolves the contradiction and makes the implementation path explicit."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Undefined/ambiguous account model (community vs developer/project/NFT collection) breaking onboarding/billing/isolation",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Added D2 with a canonical hierarchy (Account → Project → optional Community → End-user) and explicitly moves budgets/rate limits to Project, with communities as optional sub-resources. This directly addresses the tenancy join-key ambiguity."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Billing requirements conflicted (prepaid topups vs subscription+overage) with no ledger/enforcement clarity",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Added D3 with explicit billing primitives and a recommended MVP path (prepaid first, postpaid later for enterprise), aligned to existing enforcement (budget engine hard stops) and existing endpoints/flags. This is sufficient to launch paid self-serve without internal contradiction."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Dogfooding success criteria depended on 'public API' components not guaranteed to exist before Pillar 2",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Added D4 defining a minimal 'Public API MVP Gate' and updates sequencing to Phase 1.0 → Phase 2 → Phase 1.1 iteration. This prevents false-positive dogfood validation via internal shortcuts."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "API contract source of truth unclear (Zod vs OpenAPI vs NATS schemas vs ports), risking spec drift",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Added D5 declaring Zod REST schemas as canonical for external API, with CI conformance and NATS schemas explicitly internal-only; SDK types generated from OpenAPI. This resolves the drift risk at the strategy level."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "99.9% SLA commitment without operational definition/controls created legal/expectation risk",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Added D6 to defer contractual SLA to Phase 3 and publish SLOs first with required operational prerequisites and explicit exclusions. This removes the premature SLA blocker."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "BYOK 'key never seen' promise conflicted with metering/budget enforcement; unclear operating mode",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Added D7 specifying proxy-mode token metering with deny-by-default content redaction, and clarifies what is/ isn’t observed plus what must be documented as a trust policy. This resolves the metering vs BYOK tension for MVP."
