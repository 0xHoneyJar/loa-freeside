      "original_issue": "Contradiction between “gateway schema equal-or-tighter than boundary parser” and “must not reject any production-accepted inputs”",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3/NFR-3 are now explicitly mode-aware: legacy/shadow schema preserves current production acceptance, enforce/canonical tightens and must be equal-or-tighter than the boundary parser. This directly resolves the earlier logical impossibility."

      "original_issue": "Graduation criteria referenced quarantine/replay but lacked a defined quarantine mechanism and computable thresholds",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-1 now removes quarantine/replay from this cycle and makes all three criteria computable from existing counters + deployment timestamps. AC-1.4 also makes the graduation status reportable via gauge/health check, which makes the criteria operationally evaluable."

    {
      "original_issue": "Consumer-driven contract spec was defined in terms of provider internals (counts, implementation details), undermining stability",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-2 reframes the contract at the integration seam: pinned entrypoints + semantic behavior via a versioned conformance vector bundle hash. Internal counts are explicitly informational-only (AC-2.7), avoiding CI brittleness from refactors."

      "original_issue": "Admin readiness endpoint introduced without explicit authz/network exposure constraints (multi-tenant leakage risk)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "AC-1.4 now requires protection via admin JWT claim check and internal-only network policy, and explicitly states it must not be tenant-accessible. This addresses the security blocker."

    {
      "original_issue": "TTL-based invalidation/hot-reload risk given module-import-time config caching could cause split-brain within a process",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-4 chooses cold-restart as the strategy, explicitly marks TTL hot-reload out of scope, and explains the split-brain risk. AC-4.2/AC-4.3/AC-4.4 add enforceable documentation + fingerprinting to make the constraint operationally real."
