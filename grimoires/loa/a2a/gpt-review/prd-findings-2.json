  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously-blocking contradictions and unverifiable assumptions were resolved with concrete scoping, measurable criteria, and explicit compatibility/negotiation rules, and no new truly blocking issues were introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Strict parsing (`parseMicroUsd`) adoption contradicts “zero breaking changes / no behavior changes” and could reject previously-accepted inputs",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "You explicitly narrowed FR-6 to protocol-boundary entry points, added an audit-before-replace requirement, allowed internal trusted paths to keep `BigInt()`, and updated NFR-1 to acknowledge intentional tightening with required tests/approval. This resolves the contradiction and makes rollout failure much less likely."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Decision engine adoption (`evaluateEconomicBoundary`) required while also requiring identical allow/deny outcomes, potentially impossible",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-5 is now clearly a stretch spike behind a feature flag on a new/secondary path, with equivalence only on a defined scenario set and an explicit deferral clause if equivalence can’t be proven. This removes the “must be identical everywhere” impossibility."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "“95% of public API surface” goal is not measurable and encourages over-exporting/instability; FR-3 had speculative exports",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "G-2 and FR-3 ACs now define a concrete, testable rule: export exactly what arrakis consumes, enforce via ‘zero direct imports outside barrel + designated modules’ and a grep check. This is measurable and avoids the arbitrary percentage target."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Rebuild script AC assumed dist directory layout; should validate via resolvable specifiers/exports map instead",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-2 AC-2.2 is now expressed in terms of import specifiers resolving/typechecking per `package.json#exports`, not physical directories. That directly addresses the blocking assumption."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Backward compatibility claim lacked a precise version negotiation predicate and concrete acceptance tests",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-8 now states an explicit compatibility predicate (as sourced from `validateCompatibility()`), and AC-8.2 provides concrete version-pair tests including the critical arrakis 7.9.2 ↔ finn 7.0.0 PASS case. NFR-4 is aligned with this."
