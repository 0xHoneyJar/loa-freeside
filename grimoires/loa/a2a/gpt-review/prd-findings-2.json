  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously blocking issues are addressed with a workable compatibility rollout, explicit CI strategy, clarified barrel/import-guard rules, and concrete canonicalization requirements, with no new truly blocking problems introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "“Zero breaking changes” contradicted by hard contract-version gate rejecting v7.x peers",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "PRD now defines a phased rollout with Phase A dual-accept (`validateCompatibility >=7.11.0 <9.0.0`) and only tightens after coordination (Phase C), aligning NFR-1 with distributed interoperability reality."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "loa-finn coordination treated as out-of-scope without an executable gate/sequence/rollback",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Section 3 adds Phase A/B/C sequencing, an explicit release gate preventing Phase C merge until loa-finn pins >=8.2.0, and a rollback/indefinite dual-accept plan."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Conformance vectors 3 → 219 lacked CI execution strategy, determinism rules, and time budget",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-9 and NFR-5 define P0 vs nightly split, explicit wall-time budgets, parallelism, caching, fixed-clock injection, and hard-fail flake policy."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Import guard vs barrel single-import-point contradiction (direct /commons imports allowed alongside barrel rule)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-2/FR-10 now state a single rule: only the barrel may import `@0xhoneyjar/loa-hounfour/*`; all app code must import via `@arrakis/core/protocol`, including commons."

    {
      "original_issue": "GovernanceMutation actor_id premise contradicted by FR-5 requiring evaluateGovernanceMutation wiring",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "NFR-1 is clarified: pin upgrade is non-breaking because current code doesn’t construct mutations, but FR-5 introduces new mutation construction and explicitly requires actor_id sourcing + acceptance/rejection tests."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Hash chain design lacked explicit canonicalization and hashed-field selection, risking integrity verification failures",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-6 now mandates using hounfour helpers end-to-end, explicitly calls out RFC 8785 JCS canonicalization inside `computeAuditEntryHash()`, specifies domain tag construction via `buildDomainTag()`, and states only `content_fields` participates per `AuditEntrySchema`, with conformance vectors referenced."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Missing v8.x completeness checklist tying release deltas to consumed symbols/contract.json/barrel exports",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Section 8 provides a v8.x symbol delta checklist with ADOPT/DEFER decisions and FR mapping, plus an explicit statement that existing contract.json symbols remain valid and were typechecked after pin update."
