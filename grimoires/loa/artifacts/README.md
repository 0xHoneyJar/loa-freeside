# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains generated artifacts from Loa framework workflows:

- **Grounded documents** - PRD/SDD versions with code citations
- **Handoff documents** - Session continuity for agent transitions
- **Audit reports** - Security and governance audits

These files are project-specific and generated per-codebase.
They are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
