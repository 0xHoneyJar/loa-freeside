2. **Should we use "trust-inheritance" as a feature name?**
   - Is it clear what this means?
   - Does it resonate with Collab.Land users?

3. **Which docs URL should we use?**
   - docs.arrakis.community (production)
   - docs.arrakis.gg (preview)
   - Do we own both domains?

4. **Which contact email should we use?**
   - henlo@0xhoneyjar.xyz (production)
   - hello@0xhoneyjar.xyz (preview)

5. **Is the "collab.land tells you who holds / arrakis tells you who believes" framing compelling?**
