## Overview

> Shadow Mode enables ARRAKIS to operate alongside existing token-gating solutions without modifying Discord roles or interfering with Collab.Land.

---

## Key Capabilities

When enabled, ARRAKIS:
- Calculates conviction scores for all members
- Determines tier assignments
- Generates analytics and insights
- Does NOT modify Discord roles
- Does NOT interfere with Collab.Land

> Described as a "read-only" mode showing potential actions without implementation.

---

## Use Cases

### Test Before Committing
> Compare conviction-based tiers against current balance-based setups

### Tune Thresholds
> Refine tier parameters using actual community data before activation

### Build Confidence
> Verify ARRAKIS correctly identifies committed members

### Zero Downtime Migration
> Keep Collab.Land operational during preparation phase

---

## Dashboard Features

### Comparison View
> Side-by-side analysis of current roles versus recommendations

### Discrepancy Report
> Identifies affected members (promotions, demotions, no change)

### Conviction Distribution
> Histogram displaying community conviction score patterns

---

## Going Live Process

1. Review discrepancy report
2. Communicate changes to community
3. Set migration date
4. Disable Shadow Mode
5. ARRAKIS assumes role management

---

## Rollback Option

> Shadow Mode can be re-enabled anytime to pause role management and restore previous configurations.

---

## Best Practices

- Run Shadow Mode minimum 2 weeks before activation
- Validate conviction scores for known community members
- Adjust thresholds until tier distribution feels appropriate
- Announce transition to community
