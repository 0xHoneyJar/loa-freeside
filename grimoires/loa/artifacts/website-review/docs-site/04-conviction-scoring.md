## Overview

> Conviction scoring is ARRAKIS's core intelligence feature that transforms raw on-chain data into a meaningful measure of community commitment.

---

## How It Works

Rather than simply checking "Does this wallet hold X tokens right now?", conviction scoring asks deeper questions about holder behavior:

- How long have they held?
- Did they buy or receive tokens?
- Have they accumulated during dips?
- Do they hold through volatility?
- What's their on-chain activity pattern?

---

## Scoring Factors

### 1. Holding Duration
> The foundation of conviction - longer holding periods indicate stronger commitment.

### 2. Accumulation Pattern
> Wallets that buy more during market downturns show higher conviction than those who bought at ATH (all-time high).

### 3. Trading Behavior
> Frequent trading, especially selling, reduces conviction score. "Diamond hands are rewarded."

### 4. On-Chain Activity
> Active participation in governance, staking, or protocol interactions signals genuine engagement.

---

## Score Calculation

The final conviction score combines all factors with weighted percentages:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Duration | 40% |
| Accumulation | 25% |
| Stability | 25% |
| Activity | 10% |

> Scores normalize to a 0-100 scale.

## Tier Mapping

Conviction scores map to configured tiers:

| Score Range | Tier |
|-------------|------|
| 0-10 | Tier 1 |
| 11-25 | Tier 2-3 |
| 26-50 | Tier 4-5 |
| 51-75 | Tier 6-7 |
| 76-90 | Tier 8 |
| 91-100 | Tier 9 |

## Use Cases

### Airdrop Targeting
> Identify genuine holders instead of farming wallets.

### Governance Weight
> Give higher voting power to members with proven conviction.

### Exclusive Access
> Reserve alpha channels or early access for highest-conviction members.

### Community Recognition
> Publicly recognize members demonstrating long-term commitment.
