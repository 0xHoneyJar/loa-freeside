## General

### What is ARRAKIS?
> "ARRAKIS is a conviction scoring and tiered progression system for token-gated Discord communities. It goes beyond simple balance checks to measure genuine community commitment based on holding duration, trading behavior, and on-chain activity."

### How is ARRAKIS different from Collab.Land?
> Collab.Land performs simple balance verification ("Does this wallet hold X tokens?") while ARRAKIS evaluates holder commitment by analyzing holding patterns, accumulation behavior, and on-chain activity to assign conviction scores and granular tiers.

### Can I use ARRAKIS alongside Collab.Land?
> "Yes! Shadow Mode lets you run both simultaneously. ARRAKIS calculates scores and tiers without modifying any roles, so you can compare before switching."

### What chains do you support?
> "All major EVM chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and more."

### What token types are supported?
- ERC-20 (fungible tokens)
- ERC-721 (NFTs)
- ERC-1155 (multi-token)

## Technical

### How often do roles update?
| Plan | Refresh Rate |
|------|--------------|
| Starter | Every 24 hours |
| Growth | Every 6 hours |
| Enterprise | Every 1 hour |

### How is conviction calculated?
> Conviction combines four weighted factors:
- Duration (40%) - holding length
- Accumulation (25%) - buying patterns during dips
- Stability (25%) - resistance to selling
- Activity (10%) - on-chain engagement including governance and staking

### Is my data secure?
> "Yes. We use PostgreSQL with row-level security (RLS). Each community's data is isolated. Enterprise plans include full audit trails."

### Do you store wallet private keys?
> "Never. ARRAKIS only stores public wallet addresses and Discord IDs. We read on-chain data - we never have access to private keys or the ability to move funds."
