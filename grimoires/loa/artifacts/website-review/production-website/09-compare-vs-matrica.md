## FAQ

**Q: We're a Solana project**
> Matrica is better for Solana-native projects with deep ecosystem support. Arrakis focuses on EVM.

**Q: We need quests for engagement**
> Matrica has quests; Arrakis doesn't. Consider: quests drive activity; conviction scoring identifies believers. "activity != commitment."

**Q: Matrica has no free tier**
> Correct. Matrica starts at $99/mo. Arrakis has free tier with basic features for zero-risk evaluation.

**Q: We're multi-chain**
> Pick based on primary chain location. Matrica covers 8 chains (Solana-native); Arrakis is EVM-native.

**Q: What about conviction scoring?**
