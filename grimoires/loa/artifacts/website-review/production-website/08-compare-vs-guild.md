## ROI Calculation Example

**Scenario: $1M airdrop planning**

| Approach | Cost | Risk | Outcome |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| With GUILD.XYZ (free) | $0 | Access-based gating without farmer/believer distinction | 50%+ distributed to farmers |
| With ARRAKIS ($99/mo) | $99/mo | Conviction scoring identifies committed members | Better allocation |

**Value:** 10% improvement = $100,000 for $99/month

**Q: Everything needed is free with Guild.xyz?**
> "If access management suffices, stay there. But identifying top holders, longest holders, and accumulation patterns requires conviction analysis."
