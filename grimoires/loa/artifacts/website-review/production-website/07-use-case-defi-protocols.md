## Hero Section

**Headline:**
> "enterprise-grade community infrastructure"

**Description:**
> "your protocol has 50,000 discord members. but only 500 vote. arrakis identifies your real users, drives governance participation, and prevents sybil attacks - with the security your foundation requires."

---

## Protocol-Scale Challenges

### 1. low_governance_participation
> "50,000 token holders. 500 voters. your governance proposals pass with a handful of wallets while the community watches from the sidelines."

### 2. sybil_attacks_on_distributions
> "your last airdrop went to 10,000 addresses. 8,000 were farmers. millions in tokens distributed to bots. your real users got diluted."

### 3. cant_distinguish_users
> "someone who's used your protocol for two years looks the same as someone who bought the dip yesterday. no way to tier access."

### 4. security_requirements
> "your foundation requires audit trails, data isolation, and enterprise slas. current discord bots are held together with duct tape."

---

## Protocol-Grade Intelligence

### 1. drive_governance_participation
> "tiered recognition makes governance matter. your most active users earn visible status. council-level access creates incentive to engage."

**Result:**
> "voters feel recognized. participation increases."

### 2. prevent_sybil_attacks
> "conviction scoring identifies real users before distributions. analyze holding duration, trading patterns, and protocol usage."

**Result:**
> "airdrops go to contributors, not bots."

### 3. enterprise_security
> "postgresql with row-level security for complete tenant isolation. full audit trail for compliance. two-tier architecture ensures uptime."

**Result:**
> "security you can document to your foundation."

### 4. scale_for_protocols
> "built for 100,000+ discord members per community and 1,000+ concurrent tenants. sub-100ms eligibility checks. 99.9% uptime architecture."

**Result:**
> "infrastructure that grows with your protocol."

---

## Use Case 1: Governance Engagement

**Scenario:**
> "your protocol has active governance with weekly proposals. but participation hovers at 5-10%. you need engaged token holders to vote."

**Process:**
1. implement conviction-based tier progression
2. create governance council (naib tier) for top stakeholders
3. gate governance discussion channels by tier
4. award "voter" badges for participation
5. surface conviction analytics to identify engaged vs passive

**Outcome:**
> "governance becomes aspirational. members see a path to council status. participation increases as engagement becomes visible."

---

## Use Case 2: Sybil-Resistant Token Distribution

**Scenario:**
> "your protocol is planning a major token distribution. you've been burned before - farmers claimed 60% of your last airdrop."

**Process:**
1. run conviction analysis across all eligible addresses
2. identify patterns: holding duration, accumulation, protocol usage
3. flag suspicious addresses (recent buyers, known farmer patterns)
4. export conviction-weighted eligibility data
5. execute distribution that rewards genuine users

**Outcome:**
> "distribution goes to users who've contributed for months, not addresses that appeared last week. your community sees fairness."

---

## Use Case 3: Enterprise Compliance

**Scenario:**
> "your foundation requires audit trails for community tooling. you need to demonstrate data isolation and security practices."

**Process:**
1. enable full audit trail logging (enterprise tier)
2. row-level security ensures complete tenant isolation
3. export logs for compliance review
4. document security architecture for foundation
5. establish sla-backed support relationship

**Outcome:**
> "your foundation has the documentation they need. security review passes. operations are audit-ready."

---

## Enterprise Architecture

### row_level_security
> "every database query is scoped to your protocol's data. complete tenant isolation at the database level - not application-level filtering."

### audit_trail
> "full logging of all admin actions: who changed tier config, when roles were modified, what eligibility criteria were updated."

### two_tier_architecture
> "tier 1 provides basic verification always. tier 2 for advanced analytics with circuit breaker fallback. your access is never down."

## FAQ

**Q: we need to security review**
> "happy to share architecture documentation. postgresql rls ensures complete data isolation. no shared tenant data. we welcome security audits."

**Q: can you handle our scale?**
> "built for 100,000+ members per community and 1,000+ concurrent tenants. sub-100ms eligibility checks. two-tier architecture ensures availability."

**Q: we have custom requirements**
> "enterprise tier includes custom themes, api access, and dedicated support. for unique requirements, let's discuss custom arrangements."

**Q: what about uptime?**
> "two-tier provider architecture means core token-gating works even if advanced features are degraded. circuit breakers ensure graceful fallback. 99.9% uptime sla available."

**Q: this seems expensive vs free alternatives**
> "free tools provide access control. arrakis provides intelligence. preventing one sybil-captured airdrop saves more than years of enterprise subscription."
