## The Dune Advantage Section

**Section Label:** `// the_dune_advantage`

**Headline:**
> "a dune wizard embedded in your discord"

**Explanation:**
> "think of it this way: dune analytics is the bloomberg terminal for crypto - powerful, but requires expertise. arrakis is that bloomberg data delivered as a simple app on your phone."

**Benefits List:**
- [+] no SQL required - we've done the hard work
- [+] curated insights - pre-built conviction scoring
- [+] discord roles - analytics delivered where you engage
- [+] dynamic updates - refreshes every 6 hours automatically

**Closing:**
> "the #1 dune team spent years mastering on-chain analytics. now that expertise is packaged into a 15-minute setup."

---

## The Problem Section

**Section Label:** `// the_problem`

**Headline:**
> "on-chain data is powerful. but who has time for SQL?"

**Problems:**

1. **you need a data analyst**
   > "getting conviction insights requires dune queries and dashboards"

2. **airdrops go to farmers**
   > "without on-chain intelligence, you can't tell diamond hands from day traders"

3. **analytics stay in spreadsheets**
   > "insights live in CSVs, not where your community engages"

4. **data gets stale**
   > "one-time snapshots don't capture dynamic community changes"
