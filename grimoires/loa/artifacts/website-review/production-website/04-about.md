## Story Section

**The Problem We Saw:**
Working with protocols repeatedly, we observed:
- Communities wanted conviction data but lacked resources for data analysts
- Airdrop farmers received rewards instead of genuine holders
- Insights remained trapped in spreadsheets rather than community spaces
- Dashboards became outdated static snapshots

**The Solution We Built:**
> "arrakis delivers conviction insights as discord roles. holding duration, trading patterns, on-chain activity - all curated into a 15-minute setup that updates automatically every 6 hours."

**How We Describe It:**
> "a dune wizard embedded in your discord."
