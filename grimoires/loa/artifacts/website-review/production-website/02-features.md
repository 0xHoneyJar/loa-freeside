## Feature 1: Dune Advantage

**Section Label:** `// dune_advantage`

**Headline:**
> "a dune wizard embedded in your discord or telegram"

**Explanation:**
> "think of it this way: dune analytics is the bloomberg terminal for crypto - powerful, but requires expertise. arrakis is that bloomberg data delivered directly to where your community is."

**Comparison Table:**

| Traditional Approach | Arrakis Approach |
|---------------------|------------------|
| write SQL queries | zero code required |
| build dashboards manually | pre-built conviction scoring |
| export CSVs and analyze | real-time dynamic roles in discord, telegram or both |
| hire data analysts | self-service wizard |
| static snapshots | dynamic 6-hour updates |

**Closing:**
> "the #1 dune team spent years mastering on-chain analytics. now that expertise is packaged into a 15-minute setup that anyone can use."

## Feature 2: Conviction Scoring [Premium]

**Section Label:** `// conviction_scoring`

**Headline:**
> "know who your diamond hands are - no queries needed"

**Description:**
> "getting this data yourself would require writing dune queries, building dashboards, and analyzing CSVs. we've done all that work - you just get the insights delivered as roles direct to where your community lives."

**Three Key Metrics:**

1. **holding_duration**
   > "how long have they held? 2 years vs yesterday = different believers."

2. **trading_patterns**
   > "accumulating or distributing? diamond hands add during dips."

3. **on_chain_activity**
   > "governance participation, protocol usage, ecosystem engagement."

**Use Cases:**
- **airdrops** - distribute to believers, not farmers
- **governance** - weight votes by conviction
- **tiered-access** - exclusive channels for diamond hands
- **recognition** - surface committed members
