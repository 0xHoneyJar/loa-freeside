## Hero Section

**Headline:**
> "your mint was just the beginning"

**Description:**
> Arrakis revives post-mint engagement through tiered progression that rewards early believers and converts casual observers into committed holders.

---

## The Problem Section

### 1. Post-Mint Silence
> Discord activity plummets after launch week; initial momentum disappears entirely

### 2. Floor Watchers Everywhere
> Approximately half of holders are speculation-focused rather than community-committed

### 3. OGs Feel Invisible
> Early minters receive identical treatment as recent secondary market purchasers

### 4. Generic Discord Vibes
> NFT communities lack differentiation; standard channels (verified holders, announcements, general chat) are replicated across projects

---

## The Solution Section

### 1. Identify Collectors vs Flippers
> "conviction scoring goes beyond wallet snapshots" - tracks holding duration, accumulation patterns, and trading behavior to distinguish genuine believers from exit liquidity

### 2. 9-Tier Holder Progression
> Status journey from "Outsider" to "Naib"; top 7 holders become a council, transforming holding into an aspirational path

### 3. OG Recognition with Badges
> Automatic recognition for first-wave minters, long-term holders, and multi-NFT collectors

### 4. Unique Branding
> Dune-themed tier names (Fedaykin, Fremen, Wanderer); custom themes available at enterprise level

---

## Use Case 2: Holder Airdrops Done Right

**Process:**
1. Run conviction analysis on holder base
2. Identify day-one minters vs recent secondary buyers
3. Weight allocations by conviction score

---
