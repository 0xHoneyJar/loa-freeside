## Hero Section

**Headline:**
> "find your diamond hands before your next airdrop"

**Tagline:**
> "your dao has thousands of token holders. but how many are true believers?"

---

## The Problem Section

### 1. everyone looks the same
> "token balance doesn't tell you who held through the bear market vs who bought yesterday"

### 2. airdrops go to farmers
> "you spend months planning. then bots claim 60%+ of it. your real community gets diluted"

### 3. 5% governance participation
> "thousands of holders, handful of votes. people who care have no special recognition"

### 4. tool sprawl
> "collab.land + mee6 + guild.xyz + custom scripts. it's a mess"

---

## The Solution Section

### 1. conviction_scoring_for_airdrops
> "know who your diamond hands are before you distribute. scoring analyzes holding duration, trading patterns, activity"

**Result:**
> "fair airdrops that reward contribution, not exploitation"

### 2. tiered_governance_recognition
> "your naib council (top 7) gets visible status. fedaykin elite have their own channels. hierarchy reflects commitment"

**Result:**
> "governance participation increases with recognition"

### 3. pre_airdrop_planning
> "export conviction data for your snapshot. identify exclusions (farmers) and extra allocations (diamond hands)"

**Result:**
> "distribution aligned with your dao's values"

### 4. consolidated_tooling
> "replace your collab.land + mee6 + scripts stack. token-gating, tiers, badges, analytics in one place"

**Result:**
> "less maintenance, clearer operations"

## Use Case 1: Fair Airdrop Distribution

**Scenario:**
> Major airdrop planned; farmers claimed most last time

**Process:**
1. Run shadow mode to see conviction scores
2. Identify diamond hands vs recent buyers
3. Export data for snapshot tool
4. Weight distribution by conviction
5. Execute with confidence

**Outcome:**
> "tokens go to members who contributed for months, not accounts that appeared last week"

---

## Use Case 2: Governance Engagement

**Scenario:**
> 3-5% participation; critical votes pass with handful of wallets

**Process:**
1. Implement 9-tier progression
2. Create naib-only channels
3. Award voter badges
4. Surface diamond hands
5. Recognize contributors publicly

**Outcome:**
> "members see path to status. participation increases"

## FAQ

**Q: we already use collab.land**
> "perfect - shadow mode runs alongside it. see conviction data without changing anything"

**Q: how do we know scoring works?**
> "we show your data in shadow mode. validate before committing. if it doesn't match your intuition, don't switch"

**Q: we have limited treasury budget**
> "$99/mo is less than $1,200/year. one prevented farmer-captured airdrop pays for decades of arrakis"
