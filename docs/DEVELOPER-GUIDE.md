This guide provides a learning path through the loa-freeside documentation and establishes ownership, versioning, and maintenance practices.

## Learning Path

Read the documentation in this order. Each document builds on the previous:

| # | Document | What You'll Learn |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | [README.md](../README.md) | What Freeside is, quick start, project structure |
| 2 | [ECOSYSTEM.md](ECOSYSTEM.md) | How Freeside fits into the 5-repo Loa protocol |
| 3 | [API-QUICKSTART.md](API-QUICKSTART.md) | Make your first agent invocation in 5 minutes |
| 4 | [API-REFERENCE.md](API-REFERENCE.md) | Full API reference (Tier 1 stable + Tier 2 index) |
| 5 | [ECONOMICS.md](ECONOMICS.md) | Budget accounting, conservation invariant, conviction tiers |
| 6 | [EVENT-PROTOCOL.md](EVENT-PROTOCOL.md) | NATS streams, GatewayEvent envelope, event schemas |
| 7 | [INFRASTRUCTURE.md](INFRASTRUCTURE.md) | Deployment topology, Terraform modules, monitoring |
| 8 | [CLI.md](CLI.md) | gaib CLI for sandbox and server management |

For agent-optimized context, see [BUTTERFREEZONE.md](../BUTTERFREEZONE.md) — a token-efficient project summary designed for AI consumption. It is auto-generated by `butterfreezone-gen.sh` and should not be edited manually.

### By Role

| Role | Start With | Focus On |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **New contributor** | README → ECOSYSTEM → API-QUICKSTART | Understand the system, make a call |
| **API consumer** | API-QUICKSTART → API-REFERENCE | Build integrations against stable endpoints |
| **Operator** | INFRASTRUCTURE → CLI | Deploy, manage, monitor |
| **Core developer** | All, in order | Full context |

## Document Ownership

Every document has a Directly Responsible Individual (DRI), an update trigger, and a review cadence.

| Document | DRI | Update Trigger | Review Cadence |
|----------|-----|----------------|----------------|
| README.md | Core team | Major feature or architecture change | Every release cycle |
| ECOSYSTEM.md | Core team | New repo added or protocol change | Quarterly |
| API-QUICKSTART.md | API lead | Tier 1 endpoint change | Every release cycle |
| API-REFERENCE.md | API lead | Any route addition, removal, or schema change | Every release cycle |
| API-CHANGELOG.md | API lead | Tier 1 breaking change or deprecation | On change |
| INFRASTRUCTURE.md | Platform lead | Terraform module added or topology change | Quarterly |
| CLI.md | CLI maintainer | gaib command added or changed | Every release cycle |
| ECONOMICS.md | Core team | Budget, tier, or pool logic change | Every release cycle |
| EVENT-PROTOCOL.md | Core team | NATS stream, event type, or schema change | Every release cycle |
| DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md | Core team | New document added | Annually |
| BUTTERFREEZONE.md | Automated | butterfreezone-gen.sh output | Every release cycle |

## Document Versioning

Each document carries a version header (`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`). Documents are classified into two governance tiers:

### Protocol Documents (ECONOMICS.md, EVENT-PROTOCOL.md)

These documents function as **specifications** — downstream consumers (Layer 5 products, external integrators) build against their guarantees. Versioning follows strict governance:

| Version Type | When | Example | Review Required |
|-------------|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Major** | Invariant definitions changed, sections removed, guarantees narrowed | Conservation property removed or redefined | Core team PR review |
| **Minor** | New section added, significant content expansion, new failure modes or stability classifications | New Tier 1 subject added to EVENT-PROTOCOL.md | Standard PR review |
| **Patch** | Typo fixes, link updates, clarifications that don't change meaning | Fixing a broken citation link | Any contributor |

**Conservation invariant changes are always major.** The conservation properties (I-1 through I-14) are the foundational promise of the economic protocol. Any change to an invariant definition, enforcement level, or scope triggers a major version bump — even if the change is "just" a clarification.

**Stability tier changes**: Promoting a Tier 2 element to Tier 1 is a minor version bump (new guarantee). Demoting a Tier 1 element follows the 2-cycle deprecation policy and triggers a major version bump.

### Operational Documents (INFRASTRUCTURE.md, CLI.md, API-QUICKSTART.md, API-REFERENCE.md)

Standard semver — no special governance beyond normal PR review:

| Version Type | When | Example |
|-------------|------|---------|
| **Major** | Document restructured, sections removed | CLI.md reorganized by workflow instead of command |
| **Minor** | New section, significant update | New Terraform module documented |
| **Patch** | Typos, links, minor clarifications | Updated cost estimate |

### Meta Documents (DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md, ECOSYSTEM.md, GLOSSARY.md)

Standard semver. Version bumps required when new documents are added to the learning path or ownership table.

### BUTTERFREEZONE.md

Version managed by `butterfreezone-gen.sh` — should not be edited manually.

## Errata Process

If you find an error in any document:

1. **Minor errors** (typos, broken links): Fix directly in a PR
2. **Factual errors** (wrong endpoint, incorrect config): Open an issue tagged `docs-errata`
3. **Missing content**: Open an issue tagged `docs-gap` with the section and expected content
4. **Stale content**: Run `scripts/rtfm-validate.sh` to detect drift, then fix

All errata PRs should include a version bump in the document header.

## Validation

Run the documentation validation suite before submitting doc changes:

```bash
# Full validation (8 checks)
scripts/rtfm-validate.sh

# Quick checks
scripts/extract-routes.sh --diff        # Route drift detection
scripts/verify-routes.sh --dry-run      # Route contract structure
scripts/pin-citations.sh --validate-only # Citation format validation
```

## Next Steps

- [README.md](../README.md) — Start here if you haven't already
- [ECOSYSTEM.md](ECOSYSTEM.md) — Understand the protocol stack
- [API-QUICKSTART.md](API-QUICKSTART.md) — Make your first API call
