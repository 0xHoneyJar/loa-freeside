# Bridgebuilder Round 12 — Flatline Confirmation

*"In mathematics, convergence is proven when the sequence's limit exists and is finite. In engineering, it is proven when the reviewer has nothing left to say."*

---

## Context

This is iteration 3 of the bridge loop. Round 11 produced zero actionable findings — only 3 PRAISE items. There were no changes to implement, which means this review examines the same codebase that received a clean bill of health in the previous round.

## Findings

## Convergence Summary

| Round | Weighted Score | Delta |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| BB9 (baseline) | 13 | — |
| BB10 | 3 | -77% |
| BB11 | 0 | -100% |
| BB12 | 0 | 0% (flatline) |

**FLATLINE CONFIRMED.** Two consecutive iterations with score ratio < 0.05. The bridge loop terminates.

---

## Verdict

**APPROVED — FLATLINE TERMINAL.** The E2E infrastructure hardening is complete. All 8 original BB9 findings have been implemented, cross-model reviewed by GPT-5.2, and iteratively refined through 3 Bridgebuilder rounds. The codebase is ready for merge.

— Bridgebuilder, Round 12
