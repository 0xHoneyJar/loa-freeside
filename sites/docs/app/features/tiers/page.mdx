# Tier System

ARRAKIS supports up to 9 progression tiers, providing granular segmentation beyond simple "holder" vs "non-holder" distinctions.

## Default Tiers

Out of the box, ARRAKIS uses Dune-inspired tier names:

| Tier | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Initiate | New members, any token balance |
| 2 | Acolyte | Early accumulation phase |
| 3 | Adherent | Consistent holder |
| 4 | Disciple | Building conviction |
| 5 | Zealot | Dedicated community member |
| 6 | Elder | Long-term holder |
| 7 | Oracle | High conviction, community leader |
| 8 | Prophet | Top-tier commitment |
| 9 | Kwisatz Haderach | Legendary status |

## Customization

### Tier Names
Customize tier names to match your community's theme.

### Threshold Types

**Balance-Based** (Starter plan)
Simple token balance thresholds.

**Conviction-Based** (Growth/Enterprise)
Thresholds based on conviction score.

**Hybrid**
Combine balance AND conviction requirements.

## Discord Role Mapping

Each tier maps to a Discord role. ARRAKIS automatically:
1. Creates roles if they don't exist
2. Assigns appropriate permissions
3. Orders roles in the hierarchy
4. Updates members based on their tier

## Tier Transitions

When a member's status changes:
- **Promotion**: Old tier role removed, new tier role added
- **Demotion**: Handled gracefully with optional notifications
- **Cooldown**: Optional cooldown period prevents rapid tier changes

## Best Practices

### Start Conservative
Begin with fewer tiers (3-5) and expand as your community grows.

### Meaningful Gaps
Ensure each tier represents a meaningful distinction. Avoid tiers that feel arbitrary.

### Clear Benefits
Document what each tier unlocks. Members should understand why progression matters.

### Balance Exclusivity
Top tiers should feel exclusive but not impossible to achieve.
