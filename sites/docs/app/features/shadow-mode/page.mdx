# Shadow Mode

Shadow Mode lets you run ARRAKIS alongside your existing token-gating solution with zero risk.

## What is Shadow Mode?

When enabled, ARRAKIS:
- ✅ Calculates conviction scores for all members
- ✅ Determines tier assignments
- ✅ Generates analytics and insights
- ❌ Does NOT modify any Discord roles
- ❌ Does NOT interfere with Collab.Land

Think of it as a "read-only" mode that shows you what ARRAKIS *would* do without actually doing it.

## Why Use Shadow Mode?

### Test Before Committing
See exactly how conviction-based tiers compare to your current balance-based setup.

### Tune Thresholds
Adjust tier thresholds based on real data before going live.

### Build Confidence
Validate that ARRAKIS correctly identifies your most committed members.

### Zero Downtime Migration
Keep Collab.Land running while you prepare the switch.

## Shadow Mode Dashboard

While in Shadow Mode, your dashboard shows:

### Comparison View
Side-by-side comparison of current roles vs ARRAKIS recommendations.

### Discrepancy Report
Identifies members who would be affected by switching:
- Promotions (would gain access)
- Demotions (would lose access)
- No change

### Conviction Distribution
Histogram showing community conviction score distribution.

## Going Live

When you're ready to activate ARRAKIS:

1. Review the discrepancy report
2. Communicate changes to your community
3. Set a migration date
4. Disable Shadow Mode
5. ARRAKIS takes over role management

## Rollback

If needed, you can re-enable Shadow Mode at any time. ARRAKIS will stop managing roles, and you can restore your previous setup.

## Best Practices

- Run Shadow Mode for at least 2 weeks before going live
- Review conviction scores for known community members
- Adjust thresholds until tier distribution feels right
- Announce the transition to your community
