> Engagement Intelligence for Web3 Communities

ARRAKIS brings Dune Analytics-level on-chain intelligence to your Discord — no SQL required. Built on Collab.Land, available through their marketplace.

## What is ARRAKIS?

ARRAKIS is a conviction scoring and tiered progression system for token-gated communities. It transforms raw on-chain data into actionable community insights delivered as Discord roles.

### Key Features

- **Conviction Scoring** — Algorithmic scoring based on holding duration, trading patterns, and on-chain activity
- **9-Tier Progression** — Granular member segmentation beyond simple token-gating
- **Badge System** — Achievement badges for community milestones
- **Shadow Mode** — Test alongside existing Collab.Land setup with zero risk
- **Auto-Refresh** — Roles update automatically every 6 hours

## Quick Start

1. [Install from Collab.Land Marketplace](https://discord.gg/thehoneyjar)
2. Connect your token contract
3. Configure your tier thresholds
4. Enable Shadow Mode to test
5. Go live when ready

## Built by the #1 Dune Team
