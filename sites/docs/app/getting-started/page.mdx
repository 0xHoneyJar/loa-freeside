# Getting Started

Get ARRAKIS running in your Discord server in 15 minutes or less.

## Prerequisites

- A Discord server with admin permissions
- An ERC-20 or NFT token contract
- [Collab.Land](https://collab.land) bot installed (optional, for Shadow Mode)

## Installation

### Step 1: Join the ARRAKIS Discord

Visit [discord.gg/thehoneyjar](https://discord.gg/thehoneyjar) to get started with the setup wizard.

### Step 2: Connect Your Server

Authorize ARRAKIS to access your Discord server. We only request the minimum permissions needed:
- Manage Roles
- Read Messages
- Send Messages

### Step 3: Configure Your Token

Enter your token contract details:
- **Chain**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, or other EVM chains
- **Contract Address**: Your ERC-20 or NFT contract
- **Token Type**: ERC-20 or ERC-721/1155

### Step 4: Set Up Tiers

Configure your tier thresholds. ARRAKIS supports up to 9 tiers:

| Tier | Default Name | Suggested Threshold |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Initiate | Any balance |
| 2 | Acolyte | 100 tokens |
| 3 | Adherent | 500 tokens |
| 4 | Disciple | 1,000 tokens |
| 5 | Zealot | 5,000 tokens |
| 6 | Elder | 10,000 tokens |
| 7 | Oracle | 25,000 tokens |
| 8 | Prophet | 50,000 tokens |
| 9 | Kwisatz Haderach | 100,000 tokens |

### Step 5: Enable Shadow Mode (Recommended)

Shadow Mode runs ARRAKIS alongside your existing Collab.Land setup without affecting current roles. This lets you:
- Compare conviction-based roles vs simple balance-based roles
- Test tier thresholds before going live
- Build confidence in the system

### Step 6: Go Live

When you're ready, disable Shadow Mode to have ARRAKIS manage your roles directly.
