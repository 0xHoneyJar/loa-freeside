{"id":"arrakis-wf6","title":"S305-T7: AUTH_BYPASS Code Safeguard","description":"Implement code-level AUTH_BYPASS protection: environment gate, startup check, build exclusion.\n\nTHREAT MODEL:\n- Risk: AUTH_BYPASS=true in production allows unauthenticated API access\n- Attack vectors: misconfigured env var, leaked .env, container env injection, Helm/Terraform variable\n- Impact: Full API access without authentication\n- Current state: AUTH_BYPASS env var honored without environment checks\n\nSAFEGUARD DESIGN (defense in depth):\n1. Positive allowlist: bypass ONLY when BOTH conditions met:\n   a. NODE_ENV is explicitly 'development' or 'test' (not just !== 'production')\n   b. No additional bypass-enabling env like FORCE_AUTH_BYPASS exists\n2. Startup check: Server refuses to start if AUTH_BYPASS=true and NODE_ENV not in allowlist\n3. Audit logging: Warning emitted at startup when bypass enabled\n4. Build exclusion: Production Docker sets NODE_ENV=production\n5. CI policy: lint rule flags AUTH_BYPASS in non-test code without NODE_ENV guard\n6. Terraform/Docker manifests: CI check ensures AUTH_BYPASS never set in prod configs\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- AUTH_BYPASS only honored when NODE_ENV in ('development', 'test')\n- Server refuses to start if AUTH_BYPASS=true and NODE_ENV not in allowlist\n- Log warning emitted at startup when bypass enabled\n- Production Docker build sets NODE_ENV=production\n- CI check: grep for AUTH_BYPASS in docker-compose.prod.yml / terraform.tfvars returns 0\n\nTESTING:\n- AUTH_BYPASS=true NODE_ENV=production causes startup failure\n- AUTH_BYPASS=true NODE_ENV=development works with warning log\n- AUTH_BYPASS=true NODE_ENV=staging causes startup failure (not in allowlist)\n\nEFFORT: Small (1-2 hours)\nFR: FR-4 (SKP-005)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-19T09:20:53.210940484Z","created_by":"merlin","updated_at":"2026-02-19T12:44:37.029649391Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T12:44:37.029531021Z","close_reason":"AUTH_BYPASS guard in server.ts:startServer().
