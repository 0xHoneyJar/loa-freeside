# Welcome to Sietch

Welcome to Sietch, the exclusive community for the top 69 BGT holders who have never redeemed their tokens.

## What is Sietch?

Sietch is a token-gated Discord community that brings together the most committed BGT holders in the Berachain ecosystem. Named after the hidden desert communities in Dune, our Sietch is a place for diamond-hand BGT believers to connect, share insights, and shape the future of Berachain.

## Eligibility Requirements

To join Sietch, you must:

1. **Hold BGT tokens** that you've never redeemed (burned for BERA)
2. **Rank in the top 69** of all unredeemed BGT holders
3. **Verify your wallet** through Collab.Land

### How Eligibility is Calculated

- We track all BGT reward claims from Berachain reward vaults
- We subtract any BGT that has been burned/redeemed
- Your "unredeemed BGT" = Total claimed - Total burned
- Rankings are sorted by unredeemed BGT balance

### Tiers

|------|-------|------|----------|
| **Naib** | 1-7 | Naib | Access to all channels including Naib Council |

## Verification Troubleshooting

### "Verification Failed"

This usually means:
1. Your wallet isn't in the top 69 - Check the #census leaderboard
2. You connected the wrong wallet - Try again with the correct wallet
3. Your BGT was redeemed/burned - Burned BGT doesn't count

### "Wallet Not Found"

1. Make sure you're connecting the wallet that received BGT rewards
2. The wallet must have claimed from a Berachain reward vault
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your wallet

### Lost Your Role?

Roles are updated every 6 hours. If you lost your role:
1. Your rank may have dropped below 69
2. Check #census for current rankings
3. Contact support if you believe there's an error

## FAQ

### How often is eligibility updated?

Every 6 hours. The #census leaderboard shows the last update time.

### What if I burn some of my BGT?

Your eligibility is based on unredeemed BGT. If you burn/redeem BGT and fall below rank 69, you'll lose access.

### Can I regain access if I drop out?

Yes! If you acquire more BGT (without redeeming) and return to the top 69, you'll automatically regain access on the next verification cycle.

### Who sees my wallet address?

- Your wallet is visible in the #census leaderboard (truncated: 0x1234...abcd)
- Full addresses are only visible to administrators
- Your Discord identity is NOT linked to your wallet publicly

### What if there's an error with my eligibility?

Contact support in #support or reach out to a moderator. We can investigate and apply manual overrides if there's a legitimate issue.

### Can I have multiple wallets?

Currently, only one wallet can be verified per Discord account. Choose your highest-BGT wallet for verification.
