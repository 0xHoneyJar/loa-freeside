# Welcome to Sietch

Welcome to Sietch, the exclusive community for the top 69 BGT holders who have never redeemed their tokens.

## What is Sietch?

Sietch is a token-gated Discord community that brings together the most committed BGT holders in the Berachain ecosystem. Named after the hidden desert communities in Dune, our Sietch is a place for diamond-hand BGT believers to connect, share insights, and shape the future of Berachain.

## Eligibility Requirements

To join Sietch, you must:

1. **Hold BGT tokens** that you've never redeemed (burned for BERA)
2. **Meet the BGT threshold** for your desired tier (or rank in top 69)
3. **Verify your wallet** using the `/verify` command

### How Eligibility is Calculated

- We track all BGT reward claims from Berachain reward vaults
- We subtract any BGT that has been burned/redeemed
- Your "unredeemed BGT" = Total claimed - Total burned
- Rankings are sorted by unredeemed BGT balance

### Tiers

Sietch uses a 9-tier membership system. The top tiers are **rank-based** (your position among all holders), while lower tiers are **BGT-based** (your total unredeemed BGT).

| Tier | Requirement | Role | Description |
|------|-------------|------|-------------|
| **Naib** | Rank 1-7 | @Naib | Tribal leaders - access to all channels |
| **Fedaykin** | Rank 8-69 | @Fedaykin | Elite warriors - full community access |
| **Usul** | 1,111+ BGT | @Usul | Base of the pillar - innermost identity |
| **Sayyadina** | 888+ BGT | @Sayyadina | Spiritual guide - near-leader status |
| **Mushtamal** | 690+ BGT | @Mushtamal | Inner garden - trusted inner space |
| **Sihaya** | 420+ BGT | @Sihaya | Desert spring - precious, life-giving |
| **Qanat** | 222+ BGT | @Qanat | Underground channels - access to hidden depths |
| **Ichwan** | 69+ BGT | @Ichwan | Brotherhood - first acceptance |
| **Hajra** | 6.9+ BGT | @Hajra | Journey of seeking - on the path |

**Note**: Rank-based tiers (Naib, Fedaykin) override BGT-based tiers. If you're in the top 69 by rank, you get Fedaykin regardless of your BGT amount.

## How to Join

## Verification Troubleshooting

### "Verification Link Expired"

The verification link expires after 15 minutes. If you see this:
1. Run `/verify start` again to get a fresh link
2. Complete the process within 15 minutes
3. Make sure your system clock is correct

### "Signature Invalid"

This means the wallet signature was rejected:
1. Make sure you're signing in the same browser session
2. Don't modify the message being signed
3. Run `/verify start` for a fresh session and try again

### "Not Eligible"

This usually means:
1. Your BGT balance is below 6.9 BGT (minimum for Hajra tier)
2. Your wallet isn't in the top 69 by rank
3. Your BGT was redeemed/burned - burned BGT doesn't count
4. Check the #census leaderboard for current rankings

### "Wallet Not Found"

1. Make sure you're connecting the wallet that holds BGT
2. The wallet must have claimed BGT rewards
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your wallet in the verification page

### Lost Your Role?

Roles are updated every 6 hours. If you lost your role:
1. Your rank or BGT balance may have dropped below your tier threshold
2. Check #census for current rankings
3. There's a 24-hour grace period before role removal
4. Contact support in #support if you believe there's an error

## FAQ

### How often is eligibility updated?

Every 6 hours. The #census leaderboard shows the last update time.

### What if I burn some of my BGT?

Your eligibility is based on unredeemed BGT. If you burn/redeem BGT and fall below rank 69, you'll lose access.

### Can I regain access if I drop out?

Yes! If you acquire more BGT (without redeeming) and return to the top 69, you'll automatically regain access on the next verification cycle.

### Who sees my wallet address?

- Your wallet is visible in the #census leaderboard (truncated: 0x1234...abcd)
- Full addresses are only visible to administrators
- Your Discord identity is NOT linked to your wallet publicly

### What if there's an error with my eligibility?

Contact support in #support or reach out to a moderator. We can investigate and apply manual overrides if there's a legitimate issue.

### Can I have multiple wallets?

Currently, only one wallet can be verified per Discord account. Choose your highest-BGT wallet for verification.
