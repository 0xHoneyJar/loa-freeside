# Conviction Scoring

Conviction scoring is ARRAKIS's core intelligence feature. It transforms raw on-chain data into a meaningful measure of community commitment.

## How It Works

Traditional token-gating only checks: *"Does this wallet hold X tokens right now?"*

Conviction scoring asks deeper questions:
- How long have they held?
- Did they buy or receive tokens?
- Have they accumulated during dips?
- Do they hold through volatility?
- What's their on-chain activity pattern?

## Scoring Factors

### Holding Duration
The foundation of conviction. Longer holding periods indicate stronger commitment.

### Accumulation Pattern
Wallets that buy more during market downturns show higher conviction than those who bought at ATH.

### Trading Behavior
Frequent trading (especially selling) reduces conviction score. Diamond hands are rewarded.

### On-Chain Activity
Active participation in governance, staking, or protocol interactions signals genuine engagement.

## Score Calculation

The final conviction score combines all factors:

- Duration: 40%
- Accumulation: 25%
- Stability: 25%
- Activity: 10%

Scores are normalized to a 0-100 scale.

## Tier Mapping

Conviction scores map to your configured tiers:

| Score Range | Typical Tier |
|-------------|--------------|
| 0-10 | Tier 1 |
| 11-25 | Tier 2-3 |
| 26-50 | Tier 4-5 |
| 51-75 | Tier 6-7 |
| 76-90 | Tier 8 |
| 91-100 | Tier 9 |

## Use Cases

### Airdrop Targeting
Identify genuine holders for airdrops instead of farming wallets.

### Governance Weight
Give higher voting power to members with proven conviction.

### Exclusive Access
Reserve alpha channels or early access for highest-conviction members.

### Community Recognition
Publicly recognize members who've demonstrated long-term commitment.
