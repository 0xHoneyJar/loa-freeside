## Sprint Summary

**Sprint ID:** sprint-50
**Sprint Type:** Critical Hardening (P0)
**Status:** SECURITY AUDIT APPROVED ✅

## Approval Chain

1. ✅ **Implementation Complete** (2025-12-30)
   - Engineer: Sprint Task Implementer
   - Files: AuditLogPersistence.ts, ApiKeyManager.ts, schema.ts, RLSPenetration.test.ts
   - Tests: 133 passing (42 ApiKeyManager + 51 RLS Penetration + 40 AuditLogPersistence)

2. ✅ **Senior Tech Lead Review** (2025-12-30)
   - Reviewer: Senior Technical Lead
   - Verdict: "All good" - All critical blocking issues resolved
   - Report: `loa-grimoire/a2a/sprint-50/engineer-feedback.md`

3. ✅ **Security Audit** (2025-12-30)
   - Auditor: Paranoid Cypherpunk Security Auditor
   - Verdict: "APPROVED - LETS FUCKING GO"
   - Report: `loa-grimoire/a2a/sprint-50/auditor-sprint-feedback.md`
   - Risk Level: LOW
   - Issues: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM (deferred tech debt), 2 LOW

## Key Achievements

- ✅ Audit log persistence with HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- ✅ Redis WAL buffer for high-throughput logging (1000+ ops/sec)
- ✅ RLS penetration testing validates tenant isolation (51 tests)
- ✅ API key rotation with versioning and 24-hour grace period
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (133 tests passing)
- ✅ Zero critical or high-severity security vulnerabilities

## Technical Debt Acknowledged

- S3 cold storage archival deferred to Sprint 51 (documented, non-blocking)
- Environment variable hardening deferred to Sprint 52 (low risk)
- Error message sanitization for public APIs (informational, low risk)

## Security Controls Implemented

- HMAC-SHA256 signatures for audit log integrity
- Timing-safe comparison prevents timing attacks
- Canonical payload generation prevents reordering bypass
- Distributed locking prevents race conditions
- UUID validation prevents SQL injection
- API key hashing with HMAC-SHA256 and pepper
- Grace period key rotation (zero downtime)

## Next Sprint

Sprint 51: High Priority Hardening (P1)
- Circuit breaker observability metrics
- Session security enhancements
- Error response standardization
