## 8. Risk Assessment

### 8.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Sprint |
|------|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| MCP detection fails | Low | Medium | Handle gracefully, allow skip | S2 |
| Linear project creation fails | Medium | Low | Log error, continue without | S2 |
| Analytics file corruption | Low | Medium | Validate JSON, backup before write | S3 |
| Merge conflicts on update | Medium | Medium | Clear guidance, prefer upstream | S4 |
| Feedback submission fails | Medium | Low | Save locally, retry later | S4 |

### 8.2 Mitigation Strategies

**MCP Issues**: All MCP operations are optional. Setup completes even if MCPs fail. Clear error messages guide resolution.

**Analytics Corruption**: Validate JSON schema before write. Handle parse errors gracefully by initializing fresh file.

**Linear Failures**: Feedback saves locally before submission. Pending feedback detected on next run.
